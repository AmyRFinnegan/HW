Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Malawi for the period FY13-FY16
is fully aligned with the Second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II) adopted in
April 2012 and the subsequent Economic Recovery Plan launched in October 2012.

Malawi is a small country with one of the lowest per capita incomes in the world. Its history has
been characterized by alternating periods of good policy and then policy reversal. The economy is
only starting to be stabilized after the reforms in 2012. But the authorities are fully committed to
reform and a new IMF program offers an opportunity to institutionalize and better sequence reforms.
Structural transformation of Malawi’s economy will be critical over the coming years.

The CAS responds to recent developments in the economic and governance context in Malawi, and
prioritizes WBG support around three themes: (1) Promoting Sustainable, Diversified and Inclusive
Growth; (2) Enhancing Human Capital and Reducing Vulnerabilities; and (3) Mainstreaming
Governance for Enhanced Development Effectiveness. Within these themes, WBG support will be
demand-driven and exercise strategic selectivity. The WBG will continue to: embrace the
harmonization agenda, build-up country systems, and engage with all key stakeholders.

The three priority themes of the CAS have been structured around six results areas:
Result Area 1: Structural and macroeconomic policies to restore internal and external balance.
Result Area 2: A business environment that promotes competitiveness and enhances productivity.
Result Area 3: Improved delivery of public services.
Result Area 4: Lowering vulnerability and enhancing resilience.
Result Area 5: Improving public sector management systems.
Result Area 6: Strengthening social accountability for service provision.

The national elections slated for 2014 will be an important test for the stability of macroeconomic
and other reform policies, which are critical for reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity.
Other important issues which could affect the success of the CAS results include Malawi’s
vulnerability to external trade shocks and the strong dependence of the country on donor financing.

During 2006-2010, Malawi averaged 7 percent annual GDP growth, but the growth has not translated
into higher living standards for most people. The CAS has been positioned to provide a combination
of lending and knowledge work to help the country address these complex set of challenges and
improve its competitiveness. The CAS will also help take forward the regional integration agenda.

The WBG portfolio continues to grow – e.g. the Bank commitment to Malawi currently is at $970
million and it is a relatively young portfolio, of which about one-third has been disbursed. The CAS
places emphasis on effective implementation of projects so as to enhance the overall development
impact of WBG support. Going forward, Malawi has the opportunity to continue on a high growth
path but also to ensure that the growth remains inclusive, and by implementing this CAS the WBG
will remain a transformative player in the country.

I. INTRODUCTION

1.      Malawi is a small, peaceful, and democratic country, with one of the lowest per capita
incomes in the world. In 2011 Gross National Income per capita (Atlas Method) was US$340. With
a population of 14.9 million (WDI 2010), it is also one of the world’s most densely populated
countries. Malawi is land-locked, has unexploited natural resources, and is highly vulnerable to
shocks. It regularly suffers from droughts and floods. Its production and export structure is not
diversified. Despite improvements in its food security, the country still experiences frequent food
shortages, especially in the south. The economy faces numerous structural, institutional, and
infrastructure constraints and is not well integrated into regional and global markets. Despite growth
averaging 7 percent for 2006–10, absolute poverty has barely budged: from 52.4 percent in 2004/05
to 50.7 percent in 2010/11. Despite a recent very difficult economic and political period, since April
2012 Malawi has initiated major economic and political governance reforms.

2.       This four-year Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Malawi covers FY13-FY16. It is
aligned with the Second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II, 2011–2016) adopted
in April 2012. A Joint Staff Advisory Note on the MGDS II was presented to the IMF Board in July
and the Bank Group Board in August 2012. Recognizing the magnitude of the reforms Malawi has
undertaken this year after a change in administration, the World Bank Group (WBG) agreed with the
Government of Malawi to slightly postpone finalization of the CAS. This allowed for additional
consultations with the authorities and other stakeholders and takes account of the new government’s
drive to re-prioritize Malawi’s medium-term strategic objectives (within the MGDS II) so as to deal
with emerging macroeconomic realities. A government-initiated National Dialogue on the Economy
in July 2012 resulted in the preparation of the Economic Recovery Plan, launched in October 2012,
identifying commercial agriculture, mining, tourism, transport infrastructure, and energy as the five
priorities to fuel the economic rebound, together with improving the investment climate and regional
integration. The CAS responds to the revised priorities.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

Political Context

3.      Malawi went through a very turbulent period in 2010 and 2011. President Bingu wa
Mutharika ruled the country from 2004 until his death in April 2012. Originally elected president as a
member of the United Democratic Front (UDF), he soon split from the UDF to form a new party, the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Through 2009 his administration made substantial progress
despite lacking a parliamentary majority: Malawi saw a remarkable economic turnaround, sustained
economic growth, progress on service delivery and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
and—most remarkable—improved food security. As a result, President Mutharika’s DPP was re-
elected for a second term in office (2009–2014) with a 60 percent majority in the 193-seat Parliament

and also secured considerable support from independent parliamentarians 1. The administration was
thus able to pass with ease laws in support of the President’s political and development agenda.

4.      In 2010 Malawi’s record on governance began to deteriorate significantly. Especially the
application of checks and balances in the political process affected the environment for growth, the
investment climate, and service delivery. In 2010 and 2011 Parliament passed a number of laws
perceived as weakening democratic institutions and human rights. Local elections, required since
2005 and planned for 2010, were again delayed. President Mutharika and Vice President Joyce
Banda had a falling-out over succession strategies and in early 2011 Mrs. Banda, though still Vice
President, began taking her own political course.

5.      Social conflicts over a host of governance issues soured relations between the
government and most other stakeholders. Relations with neighboring countries became strained.
The downturn in the economy fueled protests and strikes that peaked with demonstrations in July
2011; the main demands were for resolution of economic and democratic governance challenges.
Development Partners, still providing considerable assistance to Malawi, increasingly expressed
concerns and gradually adjusted the size and content of their programs, rerouting planned budget
support programs to long-term investment or capacity-building programs. Later on, DPs even funded
directly essential imports such as fertilizer, fuel, and emergency drugs to keep essential poverty-
oriented programs on track. Major long-term investments, such as the US$350 million energy
compact of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, were put on hold.

6.      The deterioration threatened to reverse Malawi’s major achievements in
macroeconomic stabilization, economic growth, food security, and progress on a number of the
MDGs. In 2011 there began a negative cycle of loss of confidence, investment, and international
support. An IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF), approved in February 2010, was suspended in June
2011 and DPs halted all remaining budget support. The sudden drop in budget support, which
traditionally underwrote 8–13 percent of the budget, worsened Malawi’s fiscal and external
imbalances and further tilted an already severely imbalanced economy. In response, the government
adopted a zero-deficit budget that attempted to fund all recurrent government expenditures from local
tax revenues. This meant significant tax increases on an already overstressed private sector.
Reserves, nevertheless, dwindled dramatically and domestic borrowing soared. With the exchange
rate fixed, a severe foreign exchange deficit contributed to painful fuel shortages, idle industrial
capacity, growing unemployment, and rising poverty. By early 2012 Malawi’s progress was nearly at
a halt.

7.     When Bingu wa Mutharika died in April 2012, Joyce Mtila Banda became President of
Malawi and began immediately to address reforms. Her new Cabinet 2 succeeded in getting
Parliament to repeal some of the laws perceived as abrogating human rights and freedoms, such as
the Civil Procedure Amendment Act and Section 46 of the Penal Code. The administration also

instituted inquiries into such prominent human rights abuses as deaths in police custody and has
begun to cut wasteful spending. It has also undertaken to reinforce management of public
procurement and controls and initiated leadership change in key accountability institutions and the
long-awaited Electoral Commission has been appointed. The President also reached out to civil
society, the churches, traditional authorities, private sector, DPs, and neighboring countries to mend
relationships.

8.     Simultaneous presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections are planned
for 2014. This timetable puts significant pressure on the government to demonstrate successful
reforms in the next year.

Social Context

9.      Malawi is ranked 171st out of 187 countries surveyed in the United Nations Human
Development Index of 2011. According to the recent report of Malawi’s Third Integrated Household
Survey (IHS3 2010/11), absolute poverty has declined by less than 2 percent since 2004/05, to 50.7
percent. Although poverty in urban areas reduced from 25.4 percent in 2005 to 17.3 percent in 2011,
this gain was counterbalanced by a worsening in rural poverty from 55.9 percent to 56.6 percent. 3 It
appears from the stagnant rural poverty rate that despite an increase in per capita income, inequality
in Malawi is rising. Poverty rates among female headed households are significantly higher than male
headed households, with their limited access to larger land holdings and failure to engage in cash crop
production contributing to the higher household poverty 4.

10.      Income is unevenly distributed. The Gini coefficient for Malawi deteriorated from 0.39
in 2004/05 to 0.45 in 2010/11. Within rural areas, the index rose from 0.34 to 0.38, while in urban
areas it was fairly constant at about 0.49. The reasons for rising inequality need further investigation.

11.     Stagnant poverty levels raise questions on the effectiveness of the Malawi’s Farm Input
Subsidy Program (FISP) in alleviating poverty and food insecurity in a sustainable fashion.
Preliminary investigations show that FISP may have a differential impact on different categories of
farmers and could be an important factor behind increasing inequality. This is yet another area that
warrants further investigation before credible policy recommendations could be drawn. However, the
preliminary empirical evidence, based on the nationally-representative IHS3 data, shows that a large
share of better-off farmers are benefiting from FISP inputs, most probably through redistribution
and/or reselling from FISP beneficiaries. This may obviously limit the impact of FISP benefits on
poor households and on poverty alleviation at large.

12.    With the majority of the poor living in rural areas, rural growth through agricultural
transformation is clearly critical as Malawi strives to reduce the number of its people who live
in absolute poverty. International experience shows that rapid and sustained poverty reduction

  The difference between IHS2 and the IHS3 national absolute poverty rates is not statistically significant. The IHS3 rural
poverty rate is also statistically indistinguishable from that of IHS2.

  Poverty headcount for female headed households stood at 57.1 percent in 2011 compared with 49.0 percent for male headed
households.

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
requires expanding the sources of growth and in the process increasing the share of the labor force
effectively. This is not yet the case in Malawi. Currently, a large number of Malawians depend for
their livelihood on rain-fed subsistence agriculture. The impact from climate change and high
population growth is likely to make them even more vulnerable unless the agricultural sector is
transformed.

13.     High population growth (over 3 percent), high population density, and high HIV/AIDS
prevalence exacerbate poverty. With almost 46 percent of the current population younger than 14
years (WDI), if unabated the fertility rate of 6 births per woman will increase the pressures and costs
of providing social services, worsen pressure on land and cause further environmental degradation,
and increase pressure for employment. The MGDS I (2006 –2011) did not reach its goals of reducing
annual population growth to 1.5 percent and the total fertility rate (TFR) to 4.9 by 2011, but the
MGDS II has set an even more ambitious TFR target: 3.5 by 2016. Job creation, especially for the
youth, is a major priority. The country has a large informal sector, mainly based on smallholder
agriculture and employing a large proportion of women; only about 10–12 percent of the workforce
is engaged in formal employment. Most working women are active in the informal sector. Low
wages and low labor productivity characterize Malawi’s labor market. The official estimate of
unemployment is 4–5 percent,5 but anecdotal evidence points to a growing problem of youth
unemployment and underemployment, especially in farming communities. Nationally, youth
employment is 84 percent (IHS3): the labor force participation rate of those aged 15–24 is 77
percent, with 54 percent of these employed by private individuals, 31 percent in the private sector,
about 8 percent in the public sector and the remainder is employed by NGOs and others.

14.     Despite mixed human development indicators, Malawi is likely to meet four of the eight
MDGs – which is a noteworthy achievement in the Sub-Saharan Africa context. Health is being
improved by reductions in chronic malnutrition, measles immunization for children less than a year
old and life expectancy has surged, from 38 in 2005 to 53 in 2012. Unfortunately, the HIV
prevalence rate in Malawi is still one of the highest in the world: 10.6% for adults aged 15–49 in
2010 (12.9 percent for women and 8.1 percent for men), slightly down from 11.8 percent in 2004.
AIDS is the leading cause of adult deaths in Malawi. As for the education MDGs, though Malawi has
made progress, the quality of education is still low by regional standards. In general, though, Malawi
is doing better on achieving the MDGs than many other sub-Saharan countries. It is likely to meet the
goals related to reducing child mortality; combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; ensuring
environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for development (see Annex 4).
Trends in under-5 and infant mortality have been improving steadily for two decades. While the
country was believed to be on track to achieve the MDG goal on poverty eradication based on the
2009 Welfare Monitory Survey, however, the results from IHS3 reflect a different picture.

Economic Context

Structure of the Economy

15.     Malawi, a landlocked agrarian economy, is poorly integrated into the region in terms of
both trade and physical infrastructure. The concentration of its economy in a few primary
commodities makes it vulnerable to weather and terms of trade shocks. The country is also highly
aid-dependent. Poor management of the public finances and frequent macroeconomic policy
reversals make these economic vulnerabilities worse. In recent years, agriculture has been
contributing about 28 percent to total GDP, services 33 percent, and a barely developed
manufacturing sector 10 percent. Minerals began to make a contribution only in April 2009 with the
start of uranium mining at Keyelekera, though interest in Malawi’s mineral potential has since
intensified. However, unlike neighboring South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Mozambique, where
the recent commodity boom has re-emphasized mining as strategic for the entire economy, it is still
only nascent in Malawi. When and how much it will contribute to the economy is very uncertain.

16.     Agriculture is the backbone of Malawi’s economy, accounting for about 85 percent of
employment and about 80 percent of foreign exchange, about 60 percent of which comes from
tobacco alone. The structural transformation in agriculture that took place in the mid-1990s saw
particularly rapid growth in smallholder tobacco farms. Smallholders are responsible for more than
80 percent of Malawi's agricultural production, but theirs is predominantly subsistence farming, and
reliance on rain leaves them vulnerable to bad weather. Investment in productivity enhancements is
minimal. To sustain growth in the sector, crop diversification and agro-processing will be critical.

17.     Since Malawi is landlocked with a narrow resource base and only a small domestic
market, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is minimal. As Malawi depends heavily on transport
through neighboring countries, the costs of importing raw material and intermediate inputs and of
accessing export markets are high to begin with and they are exacerbated by extensive delays at
ports, too many border procedures, and complex transit arrangements. FDI has mainly gone into
mining, manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and services.

Recent Economic Developments

18.      From 2006 to 2010, Malawi averaged a solid 7 percent growth in GDP annually,
supported by a stable macroeconomic environment and large aid inflows. But this growth has
not translated into higher living standards for most Malawians. The growth was largely driven by
exports (mainly tobacco); relatively large FDI in a mining project in 2009; and fiscal expansion. Debt
relief from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative helped to create the fiscal space
Malawi needed to generate momentum for growth, but macroeconomic imbalances started to build
up after the 2008 global crisis and the 2009 presidential elections. Then in 2011 came multiple
shocks: adverse terms of trade, significant reductions in tobacco proceeds, and a drop in donor
inflows (especially budget support); these were compounded by inappropriate policy responses.
Together the shocks triggered a severe foreign exchange shortage. For the business community,
delays in making payments abroad led first to loss of credit lines and then to scaling down operations

                                                  6
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
and laying off workers. These events culminated in fiscal and external imbalances that required
adjustment to contain domestic demand. But there were no adjustments with the 2011/12 budget, and
as budget support grants disappeared, the authorities resorted to Central Bank financing.

19.      By December 2011, severe foreign exchange shortages were beginning to choke the
economy. Excess demand for foreign exchange led to increasing shortages of critical goods,
especially fuel, and of other production inputs and essential drugs. With international reserves
plunging, in August 2011 the authorities devalued the Malawi Kwacha (MWK) by 10 percent—but
at the same time tightened restrictions on foreign exchange transactions. As the stricter controls
drove economic activity to the parallel market, the gap between the official and parallel exchange
rates shot up from 20 percent in August 2011 to about 80 percent in March 2012. Meanwhile, the
downward slide of the economy speeded up because firms could not access foreign exchange to buy
inputs for production. Fuel supply shortages also intensified.

20.    Employment downsizing, the resultant loss of income for food and other living expenses,
and the price changes induced by the kwacha depreciation hit the poor hard. In urban areas, the
poorest households suffered most from loss of income in terms of both aggregate and food
consumption. In rural areas consumption fell for all income groups, but as a result of the
depreciation-induced price changes, the poorest groups lost most.

21.     President Banda and her new government acted swiftly to arrest the economic crisis. In
early May 2012, the government made a one-step 50 percent adjustment of the official exchange rate,
moved to a floating exchange rate, liberalized current account transactions, reinstated the automatic
fuel price adjustment mechanism, and adjusted electricity tariffs toward cost-recovery levels—all of
which improved Malawi’s economic outlook. Tighter monetary policy brought an upward adjustment
in the Reserve Bank’s rate in 2012 from 13 percent to 16 percent in May to 21 percent in June, and to
25 percent in December. The authorities have also adopted a tight fiscal stance and a realistic
2012/13 budget anchored on zero net domestic financing (on an annual basis). A sizable fiscal
adjustment is planned in the 2012/13 budget to support the recent policy reforms, entrench
macroeconomic stability, and expand social safety nets. 6 This will largely be supported by
introduction of expenditure controls and prioritization as well as by revenue-enhancing measures.

22.     While the economic recovery remains fragile, policy reforms are starting to bear fruit,
as evidenced by improvements in the availability of fuel and foreign exchange and the return of
some credit lines. The floating exchange rate has crowded out the parallel market; the premium sank
from 80 percent down to 5–10 percent. The supply of petroleum products has also loosened, excess
liquidity tied to outstanding import bills has been mopped up, and smallholder tobacco farmers are
being paid at market-determined exchange rates. However, the economic rebound has been buffeted
by a surge in inflationary pressures since January 2012 (headline inflation in October 2012 was 30.6
percent compared to 10.3 percent in January) as the kwacha continues to depreciate because of the
pent-up demand for foreign exchange associated not only with market demands but also the backlog
in private sector external arrears. The rise in the cost of living has intensified demands for wage

                                                                  7

increases in both public and private enterprises, and some labor strikes have slowed economic
activity.

The Medium-Term Economic Outlook

23.      The macroeconomic and structural reforms have brightened the medium-term
economic outlook but there are still risks, mainly associated with the global environment. 7
While the recent reforms have made the country more competitive, the supply side response from the
export side is still constrained. To transform Malawi into an export-led economy, the structure of the
economy needs to be changed by diversifying; improving the business environment; reducing the
infrastructure deficit, especially energy and water; improving trade facilitation and regional
integration; making credit more available and affordable, especially to smallholders; and addressing
the skills gap. Deteriorated governance and accountability performance also needs to be addressed.

24.     Real GDP growth is expected to rebound to more than 6 percent by 2014, anchored
mainly by the sectors hardest hit by foreign exchange shortages: tourism, manufacturing,
transportation services, construction, and trade (Table 1). 8 Growth in services is expected to be
healthy in the medium term, propelled by financial services and telecommunications. Other sectors will
also benefit from the gradual move toward agricultural commercialization. Mining and construction
are expected to see solid growth, but if growth is to be inclusive, it needs to be broad-based.

25.     Rising inflationary pressures, projected at 20.8 percent in 2012, are expected to taper
off to 18.0 percent in 2013 and ease to pre-2010 levels of less than 7 percent by 2016, despite the
recent bouts of high inflation. Fiscal policy is expected to be contractionary, anchored on zero net
domestic financing and geared to creating fiscal space for pro-poor and growth-enhancing spending.
The overall balance is projected to narrow from a deficit of 8.5 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to an
average deficit of 0.5 percent for 2013–2016, assuming that the authorities resist pre-election
spending pressures. The current account deficit is also projected to narrow, from 5.9 percent of GDP
in 2011 to an average of not more than 1.7 percent for 2013–2016.

26.     As production diversifies, agriculture is expected to rebound to 5 percent growth within
the next 24 months and continue on up over the medium term, supported by planned reforms,
such as commercialization and modernization of farming systems. In addition, some rebalancing
of public spending in agriculture is expected to support promotion of crop diversification, small
livestock production, commodity risk management, and other productivity-enhancing investments.
Meanwhile, manufacturing is expected to rebound by the second half of 2013 as firms begin to use
up idle capacity when supply chains normalize based on returning lines of credit and foreign
exchange supply. However, inadequate energy and water supplies are expected to remain a constraint
for a number of years.

  Other threats include the risk of policy reversal as the 2014 elections approach, exogenous and terms of trade shocks, and
shortfalls in donor support.

27.     If several critical problems are addressed, the mining sector could bring in significantly
more export earnings and revenues in the medium term, particularly if the second phase of the
Keyelekera uranium mine is confirmed. Depending on external factors like international
commodity prices and internal factors like power supplies and the legal and institutional framework,
several other mining projects could reach the stage of investment decision before 2020.

28.     At the moment the risk of debt distress is moderate; Malawi’s debt burden indicators
are expected to remain well below prudential thresholds. Over the long term, the stock of external
public and publicly guaranteed debt is expected to ease downward from about 31 percent of GDP in
2012 to about 16 percent in 2032. The present value of the debt-to-exports ratio falls gradually and
stays under 80 percent, well below the 150 percent distress threshold. However, stress tests show that
an export shock could breach the threshold-hence the need to diversify exports to minimize Malawi’s
                                                 9
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
vulnerability to shocks. The policy slippages in 2010–2011 contributed to the build-up of domestic
debt in 2011 to about 25 percent of GDP (from 20 percent as of 2008). Stress tests indicate a need for
fiscal consolidation and reform of parastatal institutions to slow growth in the domestic debt stock.

Development Challenges and Opportunities

Economic Management, the Business Environment, and Regional Integration

29.       Sustaining the policy reforms may be a problem. The country’s history has been
characterized by alternating periods of good policy implementation and policy reversals, usually
associated with different political cycles. Macroeconomic stability following the actions taken by the
new administration is still tentative and overall benefits depend critically on sustaining the reform
momentum. However, the commitment of the authorities and the new IMF/ECF program offer an
opportunity to further institutionalize and better sequence reforms to ensure the chances of
sustainability before and after the elections. Structural transformation of the economy will also be
critical.

30.     Public spending is inefficient and poorly targeted. There needs to be sound public
financial management (PFM) and spending that is growth-enhancing and poverty-reducing, which
depends on a more credible budget. It is essential that Malawi reduces variations in the recurrent
budget while containing its growth, ensuring better linkage with policy priorities by budgeting within
a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), more focused and more carefully appraised public
investment, and managing domestic debt so as to ensure that it is not only sustainable but also
adheres to the guiding principles stipulated in the debt management strategy. With support from DPs,
the government has initiated several programs to reinforce financial management processes, and in
2011 approved the Public Finance and Economic Management Reform Program (PFEM). The Multi-
Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for the PFEM, managed by the Bank, is a comprehensive and well-
coordinated approach to helping Malawi build capacity to better manage public resources.

31.     Agriculture, the main source of growth and exports in Malawi, is central to reducing
poverty. Expanding and diversifying agricultural exports and expanding commercial agriculture is
high priority. The country’s dependence on a single agricultural export, tobacco, is now threatened
by the enforcement of the Framework Convention on Tobacco, which would restrict, and possibly
ban, the use of flavorants, which are essential ingredients for burley-filled tobacco products. Burley
tobacco still accounts for about 80 percent of Malawi’s agricultural exports and 60 percent of
national export value. The new government is considering a thorough revision of the Tobacco Act
after consultation with all stakeholders. A major shift from an auction-based system toward contract
farming is underway. Sugar and tea are important alternatives, particularly for larger agricultural
estates (and their smallholder subcontractors), and a broader range of commercial opportunities is
needed for smallholders. With support from DPs, the government is promoting production of
legumes and has introduced a pilot program to promote cotton production. Other potential
commercial agricultural products are pepper, coffee, and horticultural crops as well as dairy and
poultry production. However, the success of agricultural diversification will inter alia depend on
adequate road access (highlighted in the 2010 CEM) and marketing infrastructure.

32.      Irrigation is critical for enhancing productivity, water use efficiency,
commercialization, diversification, and for resilience to climate change. Small and medium scale
irrigation has expanded in recent years, building the base for a diversified rural economy and
incomes in the dry season. On a larger scale, if implemented successfully through a public-private
partnership (PPP) arrangement and with due attention to economic, social, and environmental
sustainability, the Shire Valley Irrigation Project (which could cover as much as 42,000 ha, about 50
times larger than the largest publicly financed scheme in Malawi) could transform the regional
economy and help increase the much needed export base. The World Bank, the AfDB, and the IFC
are involved in preparatory activities. The water resource base could provide opportunities for
agriculture, consumption, hydropower, fisheries, industry, and tourism, and can be harnessed
efficiently for times of scarcity.

33.     Mining is in its initial stages, but could become more important in the medium term. In
addition to the Kayerekera project, the niobium mining project at Kanyika, for which an agreement is
currently being negotiated, is a good example. The growing interest that has been shown in potential
oil resources, underlines the need to put in place capacity to manage the extractive industries,
beginning with effective and transparent measures to allocate exploration rights. This potential for oil
resources also provides an opportunity to plan mechanisms for the equitable distribution of revenues
to benefit all Malawians and to define appropriate social and environmental safeguards.

34.    The authorities are currently drafting a National Export Strategy (NES) as a road map
for how Malawi can drive export growth to generate the foreign exchange it needs. Efforts are
underway to establish an export guarantee financing facility for potential exporters. Careful research
and market analysis will be critical to ensure its success: the value chain analysis undertaken by the
World Bank and other DPs can be useful in this process.

35.     Private investment is deterred by the investment climate. The deterioration of the
business environment in Malawi in recent years has slowed FDI and reduced competitiveness. The
2009 Enterprise Survey for Malawi listed the top five obstacles: access to finance, transportation,
informal practices, electricity, and tax rates. While the new government has made commendable
efforts on stabilizing the economy, improving the business environment will depend on policy
certainty and predictability.

36.      Access to finance is a major problem. The financial system suffers from a lack of critical
mass, low productivity, high spreads because of high costs, and limited outreach and product
variety. 9 According to the 2009 Finscope Survey, only about 19 percent of Malawi’s population have
formal bank accounts, and only 3 percent use insurance or pension products. However, recent
reforms in the laws governing the financial sector have potential to deepen and broaden the
availability of financial services.

37.     Delays at ports and border posts, unduly complex customs, and regulatory and non-
tariff barriers along major routes all contribute to higher-than-necessary transport costs,
making it harder for Malawi to integrate into the regional and global economy. The
government, with support from the EU and other DPs, has made major investments in roads.
Although data on road conditions are encouraging, 10 significant investments are still needed to
prevent future deterioration; a joint sector approach has therefore been formulated in collaboration
with DPs. Road safety is a major problem in Malawi, requiring solutions that address institutions and
attitudes as well as infrastructure. Rail transport is underutilized as a lower-cost alternative to road
freight due to the poor condition of rails and rail-beds and shortages of rolling stock. Only through
consolidation of traffic from neighboring countries, with Malawi acting as a regional hub, can
improvements to the rail infrastructure be justified. Malawi’s location as a potential transit route for
the increasing volume of minerals being produced regionally (particularly in Mozambique’s Tete
Province and in Zambia), offers opportunities to attract significant infrastructure investment. Close
collaboration with neighboring countries offers the most effective, in some cases the only, way to
reduce these infrastructure gaps. In this regard, a dramatic improvement in the rail sector in Malawi
is expected from a new PPP agreement between the governments of Malawi and Mozambique and
Brazilian mining giant Vale to construct a new line through Malawi, part of a US$ 2 billion
investment in a railway line from the northwestern province of Tete in Mozambique, through
Malawi, to a new coal terminal at Nacala-a-Velha port in Mozambique, scheduled to open in 2015.

38.     Malawi’s energy sector needs both public and private investments to eliminate energy
shortages, by upgrading transmission and distribution systems to reduce energy losses and
improving both energy efficiency and transmission interconnections to the Southern African
Power Pool (SAPP) to diversify supply sources. One hydropower facility is being extended, and
the feasibility of several new hydro-generation sites is being studied as part of the World Bank-
supported energy project. A US$350 million Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) project will,
besides upgrading generation and transmission systems, provide support for improvements at the
state-owned utility and for amending regulations to facilitate private participation. These efforts are
aligned with the Bank’s engagement with the government on sector policy and regulation, and IFC is
involved in discussions on options for introduction of management contracts and possible PPPs in the
sector. Moreover, the new government is giving priority to reviving a project to connect Malawi to
the SAPP to enable import and export of power. There is renewed optimism on the medium-term
energy outlook that is increasing private interest in investment. Energy could provide good
opportunity for PPPs but needs careful preparation. Box 1 provides further details on the PPP
environment in Malawi.

                                Box 1: Public-Private Partnerships in Malawi

Some years ago the government began a long process of improving the environment for PPPs in order to lower
investors’ perceptions of risk and increase government capacity to enter into and monitor PPP projects. This has
now culminated in the adoption of a PPP policy, the passing of the PPP Act in 2011, and transformation of the
Privatization Commission into the PPP Commission. Effective regulation, which is vital to the success of PPPs, has
been partially addressed with the establishment of regulators for energy, water, and telecommunications. Other
sectors are regulated by line ministries.

The existence of a pipeline of viable PPP projects is important for attracting investors to participate. The WBG,
through a PPIAF grant, is providing support to the PPP Commission to screen potential projects and identify
candidates for further development. The WBG has supported government in formulating the institutional framework
for PPP management and in building capacity of the commission itself, both through PPIAF and as a part of projects
such as BESTAP. It is currently advising the government on renegotiation of the CEAR rail concession to take full
advantage of new investments in the line. IFC’s PPP advisory department recently undertook scoping mission to
Malawi to assess the opportunities and possible areas of private sector engagement in the provision of long-term
sustainable water services and identified potentially interesting opportunities.


39.     Water resources management and infrastructure are not sufficient for growth in
critical sectors. While Malawi has enough water resources, they are unevenly distributed, erratic,
and not well-harnessed. Apart from the natural storage in Lake Malawi, there is very little storage
elsewhere and Malawi has no good database or modelling tools to support decision making. Key
economic sectors (irrigation, hydropower, water supply for industrial and human use, and navigation)
are significantly raising demand for water. As new needs arise, decisions on development of water
resources have been ad hoc and uncoordinated. There is, at present, no institutional mechanism to
coordinate investment planning and systems, and water conflicts are becoming apparent, especially
in the Shire Basin, where 96 percent of the country’s energy is generated. Blantyre, the country’s
commercial centre, draws its water supply from there, and current and planned irrigation in the basin
will significantly increase demand. Given the periodic low flows, water resources are unlikely to be
sufficient to meet all needs, thus making negotiated joint planning imperative.

40.      Information communications and technology (ICT) can be leveraged for economic
growth. Since the mobile phone was introduced in Malawi in 1996, ownership has increased (see
Table 2) and device costs have plunged. Recent installation by Malawi Telecommunications Limited
and Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi of a fiber optic network and launch of the World
Bank-funded Regional Communications Infrastructure Project (RCIP), which will connect Malawi to
undersea fiber optic cables from the coast of Mozambique and Tanzania (through a PPP
arrangement), will inevitably lead to faster, more reliable, and cheaper connections. While Malawi
has yet to realize the full potential of mobile phones as a low-cost payment system and for increasing
access to finance, especially in rural areas, the recent piloting of a mobile money product by the
major mobile operators and the increasing use of mobile phone value- added services by financing
institutions suggest that quick progress is possible. With joint IDA, DfID, and USAID financing, a
Financial Sector Deepening Trust Fund is being established to encourage access to finance and

leverage ICT, especially for lower income households and smaller scale enterprises in both rural
and urban areas 11.

41.     Regional integration can help create jobs by broadening Malawi’s export base. Because
it is small and land-locked, regional integration is necessary for Malawi to benefit from the growth of
the larger economies in neighboring countries (Box 2). Opportunities missed in the past include the
Bank’s Malawi-Mozambique energy interconnector project and an initiative to improve
environmental management of Lake Malawi. Since the new government has taken power, it has
moved to repair strained relations with neighboring countries, and prospects seem better for a more
constructive environment for regional cooperation. Malawi has signaled that reinstating the Malawi-
Mozambique energy interconnector has high priority to overcome the crippling power shortages.
Major new mining projects in Tete province in neighboring Mozambique and the buoyant economy
in Zambia could benefit Malawi both through investments in improved transport corridors and by
generating opportunities for Malawian businesses to provide goods and services.

42.     Lack of skilled labor is a barrier to private sector-led growth. Malawi’s tertiary gross
enrollment rate is 0.4 percent—one of the very lowest in Africa. Although recent gains in enrollment
due to the introduction of private institutions have eased some constraints to access, they still enroll
only about 12% of the students. University entry, based on merit, is highly competitive. However,
Malawi’s tertiary education system is regressive in that student loans are not needs-based and are
almost never recovered, which further exacerbates inequities. Expansion of enrollments is not based
on labor market needs, and there is little evidence that the private sector is consulted on program
development or curricula. In addition, with the shift from the Board of Governors to the University of
Malawi 12, technician programs in core skills areas were neglected or entirely abolished. Access,
quality, and funding indicators for Technical, Entrepreneurship and Vocational Education Training
(TEVET) in Malawi are among the lowest in the region. Although the private sector is well
represented on the TEVET board, both universities and TEVET suffer from low private participation.

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
Consequentially, analysis has found that severe skills gaps remain, including in such vital growth
areas as mining, agriculture, tourism, and the construction industry.

                                           Box 2: Regional Integration

Especially for Malawi, integration into the dynamic and open Southern African region is central to building
prosperity and improving livelihoods. Although there has been solid political consensus from regional leaders in
support of integration, some countries continue at various levels to protect national producers. South Africa exports
twice as much to countries in the region as it imports from them, but economies of scale make it difficult to redress
the imbalance. In southern Africa there are many cases where national boundaries artificially separate areas of
production from nearby markets.

Recent progress in regional cooperation, including the gradual dismantling of barriers within the COMESA and
SADC free trade areas and renewed bilateral cooperation with Mozambique, will help expand market access and the
inflow of investment to support diversified exports and economic growth in Malawi, though significant work is still
necessary to turn intentions into reality. Malawi also depends on regional collaboration to upgrade infrastructure to
regional and international markets; harmonize standards and sanitary measures; protect against plant and animal
diseases; and generate new technology. However, if it is to be regionally competitive, the country needs to address
the problems of low productivity, high cost of inputs, and high costs along the value chain through available
regional and national initiatives. Malawi is already simplifying its trade regime and establishing one-stop border
posts with Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia; the launch of the MGDS II and the ERP present opportunities to
push forward regional integration. Initiatives are already underway to improve rail and telecommunication
infrastructure, such as private investment in the railway line from Tete in northwestern Mozambique via Malawi to a
new port at Nacala-a-Velha and the SADC fiber-based telecommunications network. In addition, the government
has resumed negotiations on a regional electricity interconnector with Mozambique and is facilitating market access
for Malawian products, in particular targeting the economic boom in Tete

Human Development Indicators and Vulnerabilities

43.      Building up the human capital base is a priority for Malawi. Although primary education
is free, only 55 percent of boys and 45 percent of girls finish primary school. Secondary education
has lower gross enrolment rate of only 17 percent, with fewer girls than boys. Malawi’s scores on
student learning tests are among the worst in the countries of the Southern African Consortium of
Monitoring Education Quality (SACMEQ). Malawi is expected to make progress towards
achieving quality education for all as the Government has committed itself to a comprehensive
reform agenda largely based on the findings of a rigorous sector analysis. Malawi’s national
education sector plan addresses key reform areas including (i) increasing accountability through
providing grants to schools; (ii) reducing the rural urban disparity in pupil teacher ratios; and
(iii) promotion of double-shifting. In response, DPs have committed to support the
implementation of the national education sector through a Sector Wide Approach. As a result of
these efforts the total financial envelope has been growing and beginning to constitute a more
proportionate response to the scale of issues faced in Malawi. In line with the recommendation of
the 2013 WDR on Jobs, the Government of Malawi understands that a holistic approach to address
                                                         15
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
constraints faced in the education sector is needed in order to improve the quality and effectiveness
of the education system to provide the generic skills needed to learn and adapt to different tasks that
young people will need in a rapidly changing world.

44.     Stunting, a primary manifestation of malnutrition in early childhood linked to maternal
size, nutrition during pregnancy, and fetal growth, has barely shown any improvement since
1992, and at 48 percent in 2010 is among the worst in sub-Saharan Africa. Since malnutrition is
the cause of one-third to half of all child deaths and impairs cognitive development by 20 or more IQ
points, the challenge is to finance a coherent and integrated approach to nutrition. 13 Although good
progress has been made on HIV/AIDS, with more people on antiretroviral drug treatment (ART) and
increased availability of counseling and testing, a major effort is needed to prevent new HIV
infections. Unless incidence is reduced significantly, due to Malawi’s financial and health system
limitations ART is not sustainable in the long term at current population growth rates.

45.      Addressing Malawi’s population projections is necessary to ensure sustainable
economic growth. Malawi is one of southern Africa’s most densely populated countries; its young
and growing population is expected to reach 24.2 million by 2025. A sustained multi-sector approach
will be necessary to address the causes and consequences of population growth. The goal of the
MGDS II is to manage population growth for sustainable socioeconomic development. Its expected
outcomes are a reduced fertility rate and well-managed migration. A number of initiatives for
reducing the fertility rate are underway. The government and DPs (IDA, DfID, UNICEF, USAID)
are supporting proven interventions to delay early marriage and reduce early pregnancy by (i)
expanding access to modern family planning methods; (ii) improved access to health commodities;
(iii) improved sanitation facilities in secondary schools; and (iv) school bursaries and cash transfers
that are conditional on girls’ attendance.

46.     Although investments in women’s empowerment have brought notable progress,
women in Malawi are still disadvantaged in numerous ways. The Malawi Poverty and
Vulnerability Assessment (2007) found that women head 23 percent of all households. Though the
maternal mortality rate has been moving downward, from 984 per 100,000 live births in 2004 to 675
in 2010, it is still high. The schooling conditional cash transfer program is helping to close gender
gaps in primary education, but only 66 percent of women are literate compared to 80 percent of men.
Furthermore, in rural Malawi the households headed by females tend to be poorer than male-headed
households.

47.      The government has been providing social protection through various interventions to
help vulnerable groups manage the risks they face. An estimated 50 percent of the population is
classified as vulnerable (IHS3 2010–2011). Government spending on social protection was 5 percent
of total spending in FY12/13 (excluding FISP) but is mainly sourced from DPs. It includes cash
transfer pilot schemes, labor-intensive public works, school feeding programs, and investments in

   A recent study highlighted the widespread growth retardation during the first two years of life that underlies the prevalence of
stunting. The growth retardation is in large part due to inadequate child care and feeding practices, which can easily be overcome
by counselling mothers and caregivers. However, this requires a program shift that gives more attention to preventing growth
retardation rather than treating acute malnutrition.
                                                               16
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
improving resilience to climate shocks through better management of natural resources, flood risk,
and irrigation. Currently, many of the social support interventions in Malawi are not coordinated.
Most, except for public works, are not implemented nationwide, are not amenable to scaling up in
times of crisis, and have different targeting mechanisms, making it possible to double-target a single
needy household. In line with the Social Support Policy adopted in June 2012, the government has
therefore begun to roll out large programs to reach more vulnerable people and to cushion the impact
of the stabilization effort on the most vulnerable groups.

48.     Adequate water supply and sanitation services for Malawi’s citizens and businesses are
needed to reduce poverty. The Ministry of Water Development and Irrigation and the five regional
water boards have made significant progress, and water access rates have increased from 40 percent
in 1990 to 83 percent in 2010. 14 Access to adequate sanitation has increased more slowly, from 42
percent to 51 percent during the period, with 8 percent open defecation.

49.     Significant human pressure is degrading Malawi’s land and forests. A growing
population increases the pressure on land for cultivation and exploits forests and woodlands for
firewood and charcoal production. Land degradation, deforestation, inappropriate farming methods,
and limited incentives to promote land and water conservation have increased erosion, run-off, and
flash floods, carrying high loads of sediment that are deposited in reservoirs and flood plains.
Together, these factors reduce agricultural productivity, fisheries potential, and hydropower
generation; damage infrastructure, and adversely affect critical ecosystems and human health.

50.     Malawi is prone to natural disasters primarily related to climate variability and change.
Its location within the East African Rift system makes it susceptible to disastrous earthquakes; the
December 20, 2009, earthquake in Karonga, which had an intensity of 6.2 on the Richter scale,
caused US$13.6 million in damages and affected over 145,000 people. Climate-related disasters such
as floods and droughts are more frequent due to degradation of upper catchment areas, encroachment
of river banks, and the increasing incidence of extreme weather affecting larger areas of the country
and exacerbating Malawi’s already high levels of poverty. On average, 1.7 percent of GDP is lost
each year to droughts and floods and about 265,000 more people fall into poverty. Resilience to
disaster and climate risks is particularly important for the rural households who depend on the fragile
natural resource base for their livelihoods. Forest cover is reportedly decreasing at an alarming rate,
and the energy balance has not moved away from biomass at all. Rural roads and the rail network are
particularly vulnerable to the increased run-off rates that accompany climate change. Climate shocks
have direct effects on agricultural productivity and rural vulnerability and erode the productive assets
of the poor. Further linking climate risk management and investments with productive social
protection investments is necessary to prevent erosion of human capital and build the productive
capacity of the poor.

Public Sector Governance

51.    Democratic governance saw some serious setbacks in the last two years, but the
approach of the new administration is encouraging. Laws that were perceived as oppressive have
been repealed and engagement with civil society has been reopened. The administration has also
begun to move on overdue procurement and anti-corruption reforms and has appointed new
commissions, such as the Electoral Commission. These positive steps bode well for Malawi’s
renewed commitment to democratic governance.

52.     Over the last decade, Malawi has made progress in reinforcing public sector
management systems but their application is still a challenge. The quality of public governance
depends on such underlying issues as checks and balances and improving the operations that must
support the CAS to promote a results orientation, enhance social accountability, and build trust in
government. This calls for a balanced approach, incorporating both supply-side mechanisms in
public sector management and demand-side mechanisms by working to strengthen citizen groups and
social accountability. While some progress has been made in PFM, human resource management,
and procurement, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and decentralization now need attention.

53.      Malawi has made some progress in PFM, procurement, and human resource
management, but there is still room for further improvement. Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessments were conducted in Malawi in 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2011. The
latest, which analyzed performance for 2007–11, revealed that PFM capacity is emerging, as
evidenced by a more orderly annual budget process and more timely and better quality public
accounting and reporting through roll-out of the Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS). But budget credibility has been undermined by overspending and there are serious
deficiencies in management and operation of IFMIS controls that have caused significant financial
losses. The capacity to carry out more timely audits, both external and internal audits, has improved,
although the quality and the follow-up on internal and external audits are still uncertain; regulation
and operational guidelines for internal auditing are not yet well embedded; and systems-based
coverage is low. There is now a solid legal foundation for public procurement and dedicated
procurement units have been established in major spending ministries, though many are not yet fully
staffed. Since 2008 the government has also been carrying out independent procurement audits and is
moving to institute a procurement cadre within the Ministry of Finance Purchasing and Supply
Directorate. The Public Procurement Act is currently being reviewed to give the directorate more
powers to investigate fraud and corruption in the public sector, which was previously within the
purview of the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). In human resource management, the government is
now able to monitor the wage bill month by month and reports are sent to heads of ministries. Next
planned steps are a payroll audit and further elimination of all ghost workers.

54.    The government now has a basis for M&E, and the next step would be a government-
wide and results-oriented M&E system and a push for performance management. Malawi has
also been improving its statistics. The National Statistical Office (NSO) has experience in
administering the National Household Survey and other mandated basic surveys, but there are data
                                              18
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
quality questions and there need to be closer links between the NSO and both suppliers and users of
data, outside as well as inside government. Management of various public sectors is also being
reinforced, especially for mining, where the reform agenda includes adoption of a sector
development policy in 2012, revision of the mining law, better engagement with stakeholders on
such issues as revenue transparency, upstream and downstream management of mineral resources,
and careful monitoring of environmental, social, and institutional impacts. These efforts to mitigate
the risks associated with mining development during the CAS period are timely; several options
currently being explored could lead to significant mining activity within 10 years.

55.     Decentralization has been progressing slowly. While a policy has been elaborated, as yet
there is no solid fiscal and institutional decentralization plan. There is need to prepare a solid
revenue and expenditure allocation system and a transfer system for local governments; build up
intergovernmental accountability; and emphasize social accountability. Until there are elections,
which were postponed by the previous government until 2014, it will be difficult to make substantial
progress on decentralization

56.      Malawi has set up formal accountability institutions, but their ability to exercise
effective oversight is at times limited. Parliament’s role in providing checks and balances over the
presidency has been minimal, especially when the ruling party dominated the Chamber, but its
oversight over government ministries, departments, and public institutions has been better because
that is done through committees. While there has been oversight from a relatively effective judiciary,
there is a need to complement formal oversight mechanisms with more informal social accountability
mechanisms. In this context, it is noteworthy that Malawi recently joined the Global Partnership for
Social Accountability (GPSA) and even agreed to serve as one of the three governments to serve on
the first steering committee.


57.     Civil society in Malawi, which is active and diverse, has been instrumental in shaping
public policy. Examples of demand-side governance instruments are community score cards and
report cards, user committees, and participation by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in certain
sectors (e.g., water, irrigation)—all of which have helped to lay the foundation for more social
accountability. Since last year’s social unrest, civil society has grown and matured. The new
administration has reached out effectively to civil society organizations (CSOs), and the dialogue is
expected to result in further collaboration. Malawi also enjoys independent and outspoken media. By
various accounts, threats to journalists and their institutions during 2011 did little to dampen their
resolve to exercise freedom of the press.


58.     Malawi has made progress in building up its anticorruption mechanisms but needs to
do more to improve transparency and accountability. Recent anti-governance trends have
widened the transparency and accountability gap. This is demonstrated, for example, by the 2011
Transparency International Corruption Perception Index in which Malawi scored 3 out of 10, down
from 3.4 in 2010. Malawi’s Country Performance and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) also slid from
3.5 in 2007 to 3.3 in 2012. Malawi’s ACB does not believe it has adequate capacity, both human and
                                               19
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
financial, to handle the growing corruption. Malawi is a party to anticorruption treaties, like the UN
Convention against Corruption and the African Union Convention on Prevention and Combating
Corruption, but while approval of these conventions is clearly a positive step, much remains to be
done to fulfill the associated obligations.

III. WBG ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR MALAWI

A.     Underpinnings and Principles of the CAS

59.     The new WBG strategy has been informed and enriched by a variety of documents,
views from stakeholders, and numerous lessons from experience. A primary document was the
government’s poverty reduction strategy, the MGDS II. The relevance and appropriateness of the
proposal for the Bank Group’s program were verified by a range of stakeholders through group
consultations and surveys of about 600 representative clients. The CAS strategy also hinges on the
Bank’s Africa Region Strategy, lessons from the previous CAS, knowledge and advice from the
World Development Reports on gender and on jobs. Above all, the strategy embodies the WBG’s
commitment to achieving results both in investments and in knowledge and analytical work; the
ultimate goal is to improve the lives of Malawians.

Second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II)

60.     The MGDS II (2011–2016) is the country’s second plan to reduce poverty by creating
wealth through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development over the medium
term. MGDS II identifies six thematic areas: sustainable economic growth; social development;
social support and disaster risk management (DRM); infrastructure development; improved
governance; and cross-cutting issues (gender, capacity development, population, decent employment,
productive activities, and economic and democratic governance). The MGDS II emphasizes an
export-led growth strategy with major investments in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and
tourism. It commits to heightened accountability and transparency in the public sector, recognizes the
importance of reforming PFM and public administration, and highlights the achievement of social
objectives. MGDS II was drafted over the course of two years through an inclusive process of
consultation with a range of stakeholders. It also drew from what was learned in implementing
MGDS I. The cabinet approved the strategy in April 2012 and a few months later gave priority to the
Economic Recovery Plan (ERP), which identified a number of areas for accelerating a rebound from
the economic crisis in 2011 and early 2012.


61.        The Joint IDA-IMF Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) concluded that the MGDS II
presented a clear analysis of the challenges but given limited resources needed to be further
prioritized, sequenced, and costed. The plans need to be more clearly linked to the budget, the
MTEF, and the three-year rolling Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP). The poverty analysis
also needs to be updated with the findings from the recent IHS III. The JSAN noted that the
macroeconomic framework for MGDS II also needed to be updated because it did not adequately
reflect either developments in the past year or recent policy changes. While the MGDS II highlights

                                                 20
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
risks to growth and poverty reduction from Malawi’s vulnerability to external shocks, further
elaboration is needed on such endogenous risks as inadequate policy response, inadequate
implementation capacity, lack of capacity to steer reforms, and the political risks related to the 2014
elections. Staff recommended that the first Annual Progress Report address these issues, emphasizing
M&E issues.

Africa’s Future and WBG Support

62.       The CAS is aligned with the Bank’s Africa Regional Strategy which has two pillars—
competitiveness and employment, and vulnerability and resilience—and is built on a
foundation of governance and public sector capacity. Regional solutions are one of the special
themes, which the Malawi CAS mirrors. The first theme in the CAS addresses competitiveness and
employment by improving Malawi’s business environment, easing infrastructure constraints, and
increasing the competitiveness of skilled labor and a diversified economy. The second theme of both
the CAS and the regional strategy deals with enhancing capacity, lowering vulnerability—notably for
women—and enhancing resilience. Finally, the third theme of the CAS, public sector governance,
corresponds directly, via its dual focus on the supply and demand sides and its concern for formal
and informal accountability mechanisms, to the approach of the Regional Strategy to addressing the
foundational challenge of strengthening governance and public sector capacity. The CAS responds to
corporate priorities, such as including the governance and anticorruption (GAC) agenda. Regional
approaches are integrated in the CAS in both analytical and financing activities.

Lessons Learned from the Previous CAS

63.     This CAS draws on lessons from its predecessor (FY07-FY12) as detailed in the CAS
Completion Report (see Annex 2). The completion report concluded that the CAS was well-aligned
with and relevant to the MGDS goals, priorities, and themes, which reinforced government
commitment. This enhanced the effectiveness of the Bank Group’s contributions to Malawi’s
development goals, the importance of which was evident in the evaluation of the previous CAS;
when commitment to reform and good governance deteriorated in 2010 and 2011, achievements for
both the MGDS I and the CAS went down. The new CAS (FY13-16) is therefore also aligned with
the government program embodied in the MGDS II. In putting together the CAS, it was clear that
consultations with civil society and other stakeholders, such as the media and the private sector,
should not only be continued but expanded because they offer an alternative voice. Because
weaknesses in government capacity had slowed project implementation, financial management,
procurement, project management, and M&E should be addressed in the new CAS. Experiences from
the Education and HIV Pools also informed the WBG of the significant need for comprehensive
fiduciary support, especially in sector-wide approaches, which are central to the government policy
on integration of project implementation units. An important lesson was that programmatic
approaches can help to leverage resources; the emphasis on programmatic approaches helped to
ensure consistency in sector reforms and to leverage resources from other DPs in a harmonized way
that can increase the impact of sector and budget funds while reducing transaction costs significantly.



                                                  21
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
CAS Stakeholder Consultations

64.        In the two years before this CAS was drafted, two sets of consultations were
undertaken with a range of stakeholders. The first set took place during President Mutharika’s
administration and the second during the administration of President Banda. Nine government
priorities informed the first draft of the Concept Note. Discussions were also held with the private
sector, civil society, academia, government institutions, and DPs. Throughout the process, the World
Bank Africa Strategy was also discussed. In most consultations, agriculture, the macro-economy, and
public sector governance were identified as areas requiring more WBG support. Some stakeholders
were concerned about the small resource envelope for Malawi considering the challenges that need to
be addressed. Stakeholders also reviewed the proposed program; they recommended rescheduling
some analytical work to be done earlier (e.g., work on PFM), undertaking more analysis of land
issues, and strengthening synergies with other DPs. The change in administration necessitated
another round of consultations with government after the priorities were redrawn. Based on the
MGDS II, the Banda administration held a National Debate on the Economy in Mangochi in July
2012 that recommended streamlining the MGDS II priorities to focus more on economic recovery.
The five priority areas identified were agriculture commercialization, energy, mining, tourism, and
infrastructure further elaborated in the Economic Recovery Plan (ERP) launched in October 2012. In
consultations with the Banda administration, it was agreed that the CAS was generally in line with
government priorities as re-defined at the National Debate and the ERP. The Bank Group was asked
to help meet the more acute challenges by giving priority to such issues as energy and higher
education. DPs pointed out that Malawi’s problems had not changed with the regime change, so the
CAS was still responsive to Malawi’s needs (see Annex 7 for consultation details).

The 2010 Country Client Survey

65.       The survey showed noteworthy improvements in perceptions of the impact of the
World Bank programs compared to the 2006 survey. The Bank’s strategy of alignment with
country priorities was considered appropriate, but the survey results also underscored a need to
strengthen outreach to stakeholders, enhance engagement with civil society and NGOs, foster more
partnerships with decentralized actors and the private sector, and articulate more forcefully the
rationale for its engagements and activities in Malawi. The most critical priorities were identified as
government effectiveness, governance, growth, education, and agricultural productivity (coupled
with food security). Stakeholders made it clear that they thought that in Malawi it would be most
productive for the Bank to focus on education, economic growth, and infrastructure.


Response to the 2012 World Development Report: Mainstreaming Gender

66.       The WBG will support Malawi in promoting the country’s goal of attaining gender
balance in all sectors and programs. A gender portfolio review shows that in FY11 (baseline), 42
percent of all current lending operations and projects had a gender-responsive design (50 percent
includes at least one sex-disaggregated indicator). The Malawi program is producing specific gender
outcomes in the areas of analytical work (80 percent of the WBG’s analytical and advisory work is
                                                  22
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
gender-sensitive); policy dialogue (e.g., land and social safety); equal access to services; income and
financial markets, and capacity building. The gender program responds to six of the eight policy
areas of the Malawi National Gender Program (NGP): education and training, health, HIV/AIDS,
food and nutrition security, natural resources and environmental management, and poverty
eradication and economic empowerment. Overall, the CAS will target an empirically-based gender-
informed approach to reducing poverty in Malawi with gender explicitly and appropriately
incorporated into operations and analytical work. For instance, operations will incorporate rigorous
impact evaluations to assess the gender-disaggregated effects of these interventions (see Annex 6 for
proposed approaches to mainstreaming gender).

Linking Knowledge to Results

67.        The CAS is premised on full commitment to achieving results. The results specified are
aligned with the government’s own priorities as articulated in the MGDS II and are fully supported
by such Bank activities as the continuing portfolio of projects, proposed new lending, current and
planned AAA, TFs, IFC instruments, and partnerships with DPs. The WBG considers it important to
translate the outcomes of numerous impact evaluations that are monitoring actual results into the
continuing program and linking knowledge learned back into operational design to improve the final
results (see Box 3).

                          Box 3: Applying Knowledge to Improve Development Goals

Impact evaluations (IEs) in Malawi produce information for improving both policy and operations. By empirically
testing the effectiveness of policy alternatives and scaling up those that perform best, IEs will improve the
effectiveness of WBG programs. The IEs are designed in strategic thematic areas aligned with the CAS, such as
improving skills for employability and productivity, barriers to savings and lending, and increasing the productivity
of farmers. Malawi currently benefits from over 10 IEs supported by the WBG. As a result of the evidence provided
through IEs, for instance, the current CAS has scaled up WBG support for communication strategies to inform
smallholder farmers about new technologies, land policies and administration to improve investment in land
redistribution, and financial literacy to improve account management and individual earnings for vulnerable
communities, especially women.

IFC is strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation of its Services engagements, which continuously feeds back
experience into the design of new advisory programs. On the investment side, IFC's Development Outcomes
Tracking System (DOTS) underpins the IFC Development Goals, which are increasingly driving the investment
choices that IFC makes, and influences project structuring.

Collaboration with the Development Research Group (DECRG) ensures high-quality research and helps to build
local capacity to produce systematic evidence-based information about what actually improves the lives of the poor.
The new CAS will support IEs that are operationally-driven and fill knowledge gaps in the portfolio. Sector teams
will work closely with researchers in DECRG and local research institutions early in design of programs to draw up
appropriate research protocols. Areas of collaboration include evaluations to improve targeting of public works
programs, identify cost-effective methods for providing early childhood development programs, and designing
mechanisms for conditional cash transfers and bursaries to improve education outcomes. With the results of the
nationally representative IHS3 2010/11 data and the planned Integrated Household Panel Survey 2013 to track and
re-interview about one-quarter of the IHS3 sample, Malawi is included in three cross-country microeconomic
research programs on (i) understanding the extent and drivers of gender differences in agricultural productivity and

                                                         23
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
technology adoption in sub-Saharan Africa; (ii) links between different forms of household involvement in
agricultural activities and nutrition outcomes; and (iii) facts and myths in sub-Saharan African agriculture. The
research is led by the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) team within the DECRG-Poverty and
Inequality (DECPI) unit. The LSMS team has already commissioned research studies on the FISP to evaluate its
targeting and its effects on crop land allocation decisions, agricultural productivity in general and gender differences
in agricultural productivity in particular, and household welfare. The drafts of Malawi-specific case studies from the
research programs and FISP-related empirical papers are expected to be ready by the end of FY13.

Close collaboration with government counterparts will ensure that research findings translate into policy. The
WBG teams will work closely with government counterparts through formal training, networking within and across
countries with a large community of practitioners, and learning-by-doing through joint government-WBG
evaluations. The collaborative and participatory process ensures that IEs reflect the learning priorities of government
and the information feeds back into the policy process. The communities of practice will build upon established
impact evaluation teams in the ministries of Education, Health, and Agriculture.



Principles of the CAS

68.       The basic principles for the new CAS are thus to:
             i.  ensure that the WBG strategy is demand-driven, aligned with the priorities and
                 objectives of the government as articulated in the MGDS II and ERP, and supports
                 interventions that are both technically and politically feasible.
            ii.  build on past experience and draw on lessons from previous and current Bank and
                 IFC-supported programs in Malawi and elsewhere.
           iii.  be selective in choosing proposed engagement areas that build on the WBG’s
                 strengths and comparative advantages, other assistance programs, and the
                 absorptive and implementation capacity of Malawi. 15
           iv.   fully embrace the harmonization agenda; work with DPs and counterparts guided
                 by the successor to the Development Assistance Strategy (2006–2011); and
                 emphasize strategic sectoral approaches by preparing joint diagnostics, action
                 plans, and (preferably) sector-wide approaches, with harmonized financing
                 modalities to reduce transaction costs.
            v.   work through and build up country systems to the extent possible.
           vi.   engage with civil society, private actors, NGOs, academia, and the media in
                 designing, implementing, monitoring, and validating the WBG’s engagements (see
                 Box 4).
69.       The guiding principle is the focus on harmonized structures and funding modalities to
help Malawi to push forward country systems and the aid coordination agenda. Budget support
will be used selectively to advance reforms in sectors where the WBG has or plans to be involved
through its investment operations if there is enough traction and a supportive macroeconomic
environment. The CAS is strategic, proposing both short- and long-term measures. It is pragmatic,
concentrating on areas where government commitment is clear and there are obvious entry points.


15
   Annex 5 lists the division of labor among DPs. There are a number of very important sectors, including health
(except HIV/AIDS/nutrition) and transport (other than rural feeder roads and regional transport integration), where
the WBG is no longer engaged.
                                                          24
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
                                  Box 4: Engaging Stakeholders with the CAS

The CAS was developed through a highly consultative process involving a variety of stakeholders from the
grassroots to other DPs. Implementation will also require continuing engagement with stakeholders, as guided by
CAS Principles 4 and 6 (para 69) that stipulate collaborating with other DPs and reaching out to civil society
organizations (CSOs), private actors, NGOs, academia, and the media at all points.

Engaging DPs: Lessons from the previous CAS show that collaborating with others in knowledge work enriches the
product, broadens ownership of findings and recommendations, and strengthens the platform on which DPs can base
their advice to government and inform their own operations. This collaborative approach will therefore continue in
such activities as Country Economic Memorandums (CEMs), Country Status Reports (CSRs), and Public
Expenditure Reports (PERs). The WBG will also collaborate with others in financing operations through SWAps
and other co-financing arrangements, and participate in a common approach to budget support. This will further
strengthen joint accountability for results.

Engaging all other stakeholders: Informed by the previous CAS Completion Report, which observed that civil
society, private sector, and the media offer useful contributions in implementation or influencing the environment,
the new CAS will scale up involvement of these stakeholders in Bank and IFC-supported operations where
appropriate. The new CAS has operations that require involvement of grassroots beneficiaries themselves, such as
those in education, child nutrition, and river basin management. CSOs and the media will be instrumental in raising
awareness and ensuring accountability and transparency in projects that involve and benefit large numbers.
Accountability issues are mainstreamed through Theme 3 of the CAS, which will engage stakeholders and build
their capacity.

The private sector as an important stakeholder in the CAS will continue to be engaged, especially in evaluation of
the doing business environment in collaboration with the IFC. It will also participate in relevant AAAs, such as
FINSCOPE surveys and the CEM; as well as in some investment operations, such as FSTAP-AF and Shire Valley
Irrigation. The PADs will detail the specific engagement modalities.


B.      Proposed WBG Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)

70.     To support the Government of Malawi in achieving its MGDS II, the new CAS will
contribute to Malawi’s efforts toward more diversified, competitive, shock-resilient socioeconomic
growth in three thematic areas:

        Theme 1: Promoting Sustainable, Diversified, and Inclusive Growth
        Theme 2: Enhancing Human Capital and Reducing Vulnerabilities
        Theme 3: Mainstreaming Governance for Enhanced Development Effectiveness


Strategic Objectives and Results Areas

71.      The CAS results framework is built around three thematic areas with six core results
areas and seven CAS outcomes. Efforts to reach the objectives will be supported by Bank financing
(lending and grants), AAA (ESW and non-lending TA), Bank-managed trust funds, policy advice,
IFC investment and advisory services, MIGA support, and close coordination with other DPs. The
framework also identifies indicators and milestones for each results area and outcome (see Annex 1).

                                                        25
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
       Theme 1: Promoting Sustainable, Diversified, and Inclusive Growth

Results Areas and Outcomes
Results Area: Conducive structural and macroeconomic policies to restore internal and
external balance
·      Outcome 1.1: Improved macroeconomic management
Results Area: Enabling a business environment that promotes competitiveness and enhances
productivity
·      Outcome 1.2: Improved ease of doing business, through better economic infrastructure,
regional integration, and access to demand-responsive skills development
·      Outcome 1.3: Increased productivity and commercialization of agriculture and sustainable
management of water resources for multiple uses

72.         To accelerate progress in reducing poverty, the WBG will work to help Malawi
achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability and ensure that growth is more inclusive and
sustainable. The main barriers to achieving this goal relate to the stability of the economy and
improving the business environment to promote competitiveness and higher productivity. Building
on the current macroeconomic and policy environment, in particular the continuing credible and
orderly external sector adjustment underpinned by an IMF program, the Bank and IFC will support
efforts to:
   i.    improve macroeconomic management (especially a prudent fiscal stance and sound monetary
         policies) through more efficient and better targeted public spending, an appropriate exchange
         rate and foreign exchange system, better monitoring of budget planning and execution, and
         effective management of domestic debt;
  ii.    enhance the business environment by simplifying business processes; using effective public-
         private partnerships (PPPs), especially in agriculture, energy, irrigation, transport, and
         tourism; expanding access to financial services; easing energy and other infrastructure
         constraints; promoting entrepreneurship and increasing skills; and promoting regional
         integration by enhancing access to ports through smoother railway and road connectivity and
         streamlining cross-border customs clearance; and
 iii.    diversify the economy and increase productivity, particularly for crops and exports, and build
         land and water resource management and institutional capacity.


Results Area: Constructive structural and macroeconomic policies to restore internal and
external balances

Outcome 1.1: Improved Macroeconomic management

73.     The World Bank, coordinating with the IMF, will support the government structural
and macroeconomic policy reforms needed to restore and sustain internal and external
balances. The Bank will continue to support reforms designed to restore macroeconomic stability,
accelerate the resumption of growth, and mitigate the impact on vulnerable households of the
economic adjustment process. Specifically, the Bank will support budget and treasury management
                                                26
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
reforms to help bring about more efficient and better targeted use of public resources. To improve the
credibility of the budget, the Bank will support a prudent and transparent approach to budgeting and
deepen the strategic medium-term perspective for planning and managing public resources. This will
also help ensure better linkage between policy priorities and the budget by improving multiyear
budgeting and the quality of public investments. This is expected to help reduce variations in primary
spending while containing its growth. The effect of these efforts should be to enhance fiscal
efficiency and effective delivery of services to the poor and the most vulnerable. Among instruments
to support this outcome are the Rapid Response Development Policy Grant (RRDPG), the new
Development Policy Operation (DPO) series, the Public Expenditure Review, and the PFEM MDTF.

Results Area: Enabling a business environment that promotes competitiveness and enhances
productivity

Outcome 1.2: Improved ease of doing business through better economic infrastructure,
regional integration, and access to demand-responsive skills development

74.      Improving the business environment in Malawi will require facilitating start-up of both
formal and informal businesses and employment creation by simplifying business requirements,
facilitating access to credit, improving public-private dialogue, and removing unnecessary barriers to
trade, especially nontariff barriers. The Bank and IFC have been working closely with the
Government of Malawi to address Malawi’s continuing slide in the Doing Business rankings through
targeted technical assistance on Companies Act reform to simplify business operations and on reform
of the Insolvency and Secured Transactions/Collateral Registry to address access to finance,
especially for small and medium enterprises. Work also continues on addressing Malawi’s worst
Doing Business indicator, trading across borders, where the time, number of documents required, and
costs are above the regional average. The WBG will continue to support the government’s efforts
related to the Doing Business Reform Memorandum drafted jointly by the government and the WBG
Doing Business Reform Unit.

75.      In the financial sector, the major goal of the CAS will be to increase the number of
Malawians who are enrolled in the banking system, especially women (only 17 percent of adult
women are formally banked; Finscope Survey, 2009). Working closely with DfID and USAID as
well as other partners, the Bank will use the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (FSTAP,
FY11) and the Malawi Financial Sector Deepening Trust (MFSDT) to achieve this by, e.g.,
promoting mobile technology and branchless banking to increase rural access, putting in place an
interoperable national switch, and launching financial literacy programs. IFC will continue to build
its portfolio of funding and technical assistance to the banking sector, aimed primarily at increasing
access to finance for Small and Medium Enterprises. The Mining TA Project (FY11) will help to
improve governance of the mining sector and its contribution to sustainable, diversified, and
inclusive growth; Bank activity in this area is closely coordinated with the EU and France.

76.    Improving economic infrastructure is essential to increase competitiveness and attract
potential investors. Unreliable power and water supplies and excessive transport costs must be
addressed. The WBG strategy is to support both analysis and direct project interventions and to
                                             27
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
encourage private investment through PPPs. The Bank and IFC will continue to work closely with
other DPs supporting the energy sector, notably the MCC, whose program has a substantial energy
sector governance component, and with the AfDB and other DPs active in the sector. It will also
coordinate closely with the government’s own investments to build capacity for power generation,
transmission, and distribution through the current Bank Energy Sector Improvement Project (FY11)
and through non-lending activities. This project will make the transmission network more efficient,
reducing losses, and will undertake feasibility studies to attract financing for new hydropower
schemes. A transmission interconnection link to the SAPP would be one of the fastest solutions to
Malawi’s serious energy shortages through a Regional Energy Project (FY14/15). The governments
of Malawi and Mozambique are currently discussing this project, which would revive a 2007 effort.
In FY13 the Bank will support updating of the 2005 Malawi Transport Cost Study to maximize the
effectiveness of investments in reducing transport costs. Through the Regional Southern Africa Trade
and Transport Facilitation Program, Malawi may benefit from regional IDA resources to help finance
rehabilitation of the North-South Corridor, road safety improvements, activities to mitigate the
impact of HIV/AIDS on corridor users, and measures to facilitate trade, such as upgrading Malawi’s
border posts. The safety of Malawi’s paved road network will be assessed with support from the
Global Road Safety Facility. The WBG will support the government in promoting PPPs to leverage
resources to address investment deficits in energy, irrigation, transport, water and other sectors
through transaction-specific support. A screening process, funded by PPIAF, is underway to identify
candidate projects and help prepare a pipeline of opportunities that will attract investors. The WBG
and AfDB have established a Joint Infrastructure Unit in recognition of the major investments
required and the regional complexities of many infrastructure projects in Malawi. The unit (staffed
by WBG and AfDB personnel, with financial support from DfID) is looking first at transport and
water projects as well as regional integration. These upstream initiatives will act as a feeder of
potential PPP's that IFC's Advisory Services will be able to convert into realized projects. The
institutions are thus working closely to ensure adequate feedback loops are in place to improve the
chances of success, focusing in the first instance on hard infrastructure such as electricity, water, rail,
and subsequently on social services such as education and health.

77.     The benefits to Malawi from regional integration and connectivity are twofold: (i)
improvement of energy, transport, and telecommunications services, and (ii) commercial
opportunities offered by regional trade. They are closely linked: more reliable energy will make
manufacturing and mining more competitive, and efficient cross-border transport links will
encourage trade, reducing the costs. The WBG will seek to advance regional integration by
undertaking analytical work on sub-regional growth poles and supporting initiatives to remove
logistical bottlenecks. A concessionaire currently operates Malawi’s rail network; with PPIAF
funding and in collaboration with the EU, the WBG is supporting government renegotiation of the
agreement in order to attract additional investment and improve the service. The Bank is also
working with the government through the Regional Communications Infrastructure Project (RCIP,
FY09) to improve international ICT connectivity and sector regulation. Infrastructure improvements
are being driven by transport needs in both Malawi and the region. The timing of infrastructure
investments will be influenced by the economic and political scenario. Current investments in the
Tete coalfields in Mozambique, about 200km from Blantyre, are fuelling unprecedented economic
growth in the region, providing potential business opportunities for Malawian manufacturers and
                                               28
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
service suppliers. For example, Blantyre has a significant manufacturing base; the Tete area does not.
This and other opportunities will be investigated through a planned regional growth pole TA that will
cover a number of countries in addition to Malawi and Mozambique (in addition to a Malawi specific
TA). A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) update is also to be carried out in FY 13. In
addition, with the recent launch of an Accelerated Program for Economic Integration by the
Governments of Seychelles, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, and Zambia, discussions have begun
on a possible regional DPO to push forward reforms that will reduce trade barriers.

78.      The supply of skilled workers in Malawi is severely inadequate, both quantitatively and
qualitatively. Success in expanding primary education has put further pressure on a flimsy post-
basic education system. To ensure knowledge-driven economic growth and poverty reduction, the
Government of Malawi has committed to supporting equitable expansion of post-basic education and
university and TEVET programs that are directly linked to growth sectors suffering skills shortages.
The government has asked the WBG to help draw up strategies to ensure more efficient and strategic
use of government funds and to introduce a transparent and objective mechanism to allocate public
funds to higher education institutions that put in place programs in areas that the private sector will
not cover, while also increasing capacity and provision of post-secondary education through private
sources. The WBG will support this objective through comprehensive analyses of the 2009
Enterprise Survey and the skills development needs that underpin a new operation, the Higher
Education and Skills Development Project (FY14). The proposed project will concentrate on getting
the skills development system closer to the labor market by consulting industry groups in key growth
areas on designing a more rational and effective model for financing higher education, revising
standards and curricula, establishing a forceful quality assurance system, and building both national
and institutional management capacities. Close collaboration with DfID, the ILO, AfDB, and other
DPs is envisaged.

Outcome 1.3: Increased productivity and commercialization of agriculture and sustainable
management of water resources for multiple uses

79.     Transformation and modernization of smallholder agriculture is at the core of the new
Agricultural Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp), which was formulated under CAADP auspices
and constitutes the reference investment framework shared by the government and DPs. Following
the ASWAp, the Bank and IFC will promote inclusive smallholder-based growth with the objective
of modernizing and transforming the smallholder subsistence farming system into commercial and
market-oriented agriculture. However, among the barriers to agricultural transformation are low
productivity, very small land holdings with insecure tenure, recurrent drought, lack of access to
financial services and to market information, and scarce and expensive transport to markets. IFC is
already engaging in providing capital and advisory services targeted at medium-sized farmers who
have the potential to move quickly from subsistence farming into commercial agriculture and to act
as leaders through integrated assistance packages to commercial banks in Malawi.

80.    The WBG support for transforming smallholder agriculture will address critical
structural challenges by giving priority to the following:

                                                  29
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
•   The efficiency and balance of public investments in agriculture, through an Agriculture Public
    Expenditures Review (AgPER) that will evaluate the outcomes of the entire agricultural program
    and special initiatives such as the Farm Input Subsidy program (FISP). The combination of the
    this AgPER with a DfID-funded impact evaluation of FISP will provide valuable information
    about the efficiency and relevance of the fertilizer and seed subsidy and should facilitate well-
    informed discussion of the objectives and design of the FISP.
•   Increasing the productivity of maize and rice in particular to improve food security: (i) support
    scaling up current research and extension activities (under the Agricultural Sector Wide
    Approach – Support Project Additional Financing (ASWAp-SP AF) and the eventual MDTF)
    and (ii) expand rehabilitation and construction of new irrigation schemes and also help build
    capacity for investment planning for irrigation.
•   Diversifying, by scaling up investments in legume production (groundnuts, soya beans, pigeon
    peas), which is important for diversifying household diets as well as providing income
    opportunities, and by opening up new export windows, especially within the region’s markets.
    Increasing the availability of legume seed is the first priority in building this supply chain. IFC is
    currently exploring additional support to an existing client in this sector (ETG).
•   Commercializing agriculture by improving access to market through more efficient and
    coordinated planning of tertiary, district, and community road improvements and maintenance
    geared to the volumes of production that must be transported. Improvements to the business
    environment through a focused IFC Investment Climate advisory engagement should also
    facilitate expansion of contract farming arrangements between private agribusiness investors and
    smallholders to control production, facilitate market access, and promote produce quality that
    meets international standards. Furthermore, IFC will explore opportunities for private provision
    of bulk storage facilities and warehouse receipts programs to enhance access to market
    infrastructure and value chain liquidity.
•   Land policy and land tenure for an efficient agribusiness environment, especially for
    smallholders; this will certainly require an efficient land market where tenure security is
    guaranteed, and processing of land transfer transactions is transparent, fair, and efficient, and
    structural constraints do not limit access to markets. Larger average land holding size will
    certainly speed transformation of the traditional subsistence farming system into a modernized,
    diversified, and market-oriented agriculture.


81.     The World Bank (with co-financing from the Government of Norway) previously
contributed to the elaboration of the ASWAp and is supporting it through the ASWAp-SP
(FY08), which is designed to improve the effectiveness of investments in food security and
sustainable agricultural growth. In FY12 the WBG approved additional financing to increase the
impact of the ASWAp-SP on smallholder productivity by scaling up research and extension activities
and improving market access through improvement and sustainable management of feeder roads. The
new financing is complemented by funding from other DPs through an MDTF. A regional project
(FY13) will also promote agricultural productivity by creating regional centers of excellence in
research and development (R&D) in Malawi, Zambia, and Mozambique.


                                                   30
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
82.     The Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods, and Agricultural Development Project (IRLADP,
FY06) has benefitted from additional financing from the Rapid Response Program (FY13) for
scaling-up activities such as the input-for-assets program to cushion the effect of the crisis on the
rural poor and enhance the developmental impact of irrigation. It will also consolidate the gains
achieved so far with water user associations and irrigation services and prepare for future irrigation
investments.

83.      These operations will be followed by an ASWAp-SP Phase 2 or Agricultural
Commercialization and Rural Growth Project (FY15) focusing more on the diversification and
commercialization objectives. This follow-up ASWAp-SP will be a consolidated operation linking
agricultural commercialization, research and extension, the business environment for private
investments, improved agricultural water management, and sustainable rural access. It could be
complemented by investments in land issues, especially in improving land administration and
facilitating land redistribution to smallholders through targeted actions based on the impact
evaluation of the Community-Based Rural Land Development Project. Of course, given different
sector orientations, multi-sector operations face many difficulties in areas like implementation
arrangements. However, with careful design, a consolidated operation is likely to lead to better and
more sustainable outcomes than a large number of small stand-alone operations that are not well-
coordinated. Central to success for such projects is clear allocation of responsibilities for activities to
appropriate sectors, with a steering committee to oversee progress. A similar approach has been
successful elsewhere in the region.

84.     Future investments in agricultural commercialization and agribusiness development
will be conceived in a growth pole approach supported by irrigation development to enable
productivity growth and high-return agriculture. One proposed significant investment would
expand irrigation in the Shire Valley (Shire Valley Irrigation Project, FY16), where large scale
market-led irrigation has the potential to transform the region. Where the area is currently among the
poorest in Malawi, with the appropriate investments and support, the climatic, agro-ecological, transport
and market conditions would enable a radical transformation of this area into a high productive growth
pole with regional significance. If successfully implemented and drawing in significant investments in the
value chains, this would not only provide local farming households the opportunity to improve their
livelihoods, but also attract investments and become a source of added value and export earnings.
Proceeding with this operation will depend on macroeconomic performance and the business
environment because it does require large scale private-sector participation. This investment is
currently envisioned as a PPP with involvement of both IFC and MIGA and collaboration with other
development banks, including in preparations already with the African Development Bank. IFC's
involvement in this operation will enable the WBG to test market appetite and feed reactions back
into the project design.

85.    Improving sustainable access to water through an integrated water management
system, addressing increasingly conflicting economic and social demands on water resources,
and enabling collaborative planning for growth are MGDS goals that the CAS will support.
Especially in the Shire Basin, critical planned developments will put large demands on the system; at
the same time attention is urgently needed to management of climate and resource variability and the
                                                    31
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
deterioration of supporting ecosystems that undermines the resources on which growth is founded.
To enable sustained economic growth in different water-dependent sectors and protect the resource
base, the WBG, the government, and other DPs are working together to harmonize and implement
Malawi’s new Water Resources Investment Strategy (2011); build the infrastructure necessary for
enabling and sustaining economic growth in water-using sectors; and promote integrated planning
and building basin institutions for making decisions on water allocation and investment. Milestones
for the water and natural resources planning sector include setting up a collaborative planning
framework for management and development of the Shire Basin; better hydro-meteorological
systems and real-time decision-making support for basin water allocation and release strategies;
upgrading the Kamuzu Barrage, which regulates flow in the Shire River and makes it possible to
increase average firm production in the Shire cascade of hydropower plants and other uses;
increasing the irrigated area in the basin; and better management of the water supply for Blantyre.
The WBG will support detailed design and scoping for financing development of water resources to
augment water supply to the major cities and towns, most prominently Blantyre/Limbe and
Lilongwe, where urbanization and industrial growth are reaching the limits of current capacity. These
investments will be pursued to harness resources most efficiently for multiple benefits, such as
energy production, irrigated agriculture, fisheries, industry, transport, and water supply, working
through the National Water Development Program (FY07), the Shire River Basin Management
Project (Phase I; FY12), and support for regional dialogue. They will also build on strategic planning
and design work carried out under the National Water Development Program and Global Facility for
Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)–funded disaster risk management work.

Results Areas and Outcomes
Results Area: Improved delivery of public services
·       Outcome 2.1: Improved access to quality education, reliable nutrition, HIV/AIDS services,
and sustainable water supply and sanitation services
Results Area: Lowering vulnerability and enhancing resilience
·       Outcome 2.2: Improved resilience for poor communities through adequate social safety nets,
improved climate resilience, and enhanced capacity to respond to disaster risks

86.     The government is committed to accelerating progress toward the MGDS and
enhancing Malawi’s human resources. The MGDS II stresses the need to improve delivery of
social services in education, health, nutrition, youth development, and water and sanitation. The
government is also committed to integrating into the development process climate change mitigation
and adaptation and natural resource and environmental management. The WBG will selectively
support elements of these efforts.

87.     Improving the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of health care delivery is vital. Main
bottlenecks are the management and distribution of human resources, management and
accountability for health system finances, the supply chain for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies,
and the quality of service. The Bank’s HIV/AIDS and nutrition operations are designed to achieve
specific measurable outcomes while helping to address system-wide concerns. HIV/AIDS and
nutrition interventions will focus on the capacity to work effectively with other sectors, such as
agriculture, education, and social protection, to ensure an integrated approach to improving the health
and nutrition of Malawians.

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
88.     Malawi has the lowest learning outcomes in the region. Since most Malawians are likely
to be working on family farms or in the informal sector, providing them with fundamental reading
and numeracy skills is critical. Rigorous analysis in the World Bank’s education country status report
suggests that inadequate school infrastructure, financial constraints, and exorbitant teacher-pupil
ratios are factors in the low levels of student learning. The government’s National Education Sector
Plan (NESP) is structured in terms of the three areas of access and equity, quality, and governance.
The access dimension covers demand-side interventions that address critical equity issues as well as
more conventional supply-side interventions in terms of classroom construction and procurement of
teaching and learning materials. Both the government and DPs recognize that this piecemeal
approach to planning is highly inefficient and that to be effective changes will require a more
comprehensive approach. Thus the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology is working
closely with the ministries of Agriculture; Youth, Children and Development; and Local Government
and Rural Development to deliver the goals detailed in its plan. Pooled resources from the WBG, the
Global Partnership for Education, DfID, the German Development Cooperation (GDC), and
UNICEF are supporting the NESP. Close collaboration with all other partners that support the
program with parallel financing, such as USAID, WFP, and JICA, will continue through the SWAp.

89.     The National Nutrition Policy and Strategic Plan (2007–2012) is being reviewed in light
of new developments and increased donor support. CIDA, Irish Aid, USAID, UNICEF, EU, and
the FAO, among other DPs, have expressed keen interest in supporting the nutrition policy agenda
through consolidated community-based programs in order to prevent and control the most common
nutrition disorders, particularly among vulnerable groups. The Bank participates in the Donor
Nutrition Security Support Group to leverage and harmonize support. It will address governance
failures by strengthening the capacity of the government and its partners to scale up programs to
improve access to nutrition information and services to prevent growth faltering in early childhood.
An Infant and Child Feeding Study (FY11) provided valuable analytical and policy insights and
helped guide project design.

90.     The WBG proposes to continue supporting the objectives of the National HIV/AIDS
Strategic Plan (NSP) (2011-2016) that prioritize reducing new infections as being critical to
mitigate the burden of the epidemic. Support through the Multi-sectoral AIDS Project (MAP) is
continued under the follow-on operation (Nutrition, HIV, and AIDS Project, FY12) which also
contributes to a pool arrangement. The HIV Pool is administered by the National AIDS Commission.
The Bank will use the Nutrition, HIV, and AIDS Project to earmark pool funding for the prevention
programs that have the greatest impact on new HIV infections, building upon and complementing the
effort supported by the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The project is
emphasizing the scaling up of voluntary medical male circumcision and neonatal circumcision;
reducing pediatric infections by increasing access to prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission
programs; improving access to male and female condoms; preventing unwanted pregnancies among
women living with HIV; promoting early infant diagnosis; and reducing transmission of, and
morbidity from, sexually transmitted infections. Participation in the HIV Pool has permitted the Bank
to discuss with representatives of the health sector reforms to strengthen the system and Malawi’s
capacity to manage and implement the national response across the country through better M&E,
supply chain management; and health care waste management. The IDA contribution to the HIV
                                                  34
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
Pool complements treatment activities provided outside the pool by the Global Fund to Fights AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria.

91.     Design of the Nutrition, HIV, and AIDS Project was informed by analytic work on
nutrition conducted in Malawi with Bank support, by assessments of experience from similar
Bank-funded operations elsewhere in Africa, and by the evidence base for interventions to reduce
HIV incidence, such as lessons learned from past projects in Malawi. Rather than depending on
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) indicators collected every five years, the project will use a
more selective set of program-based indicators which will allow for closer monitoring.

92.     The National Water Development Program has attracted financing from eight DPs in
addition to the World Bank (Second National Water Development Project, FY07, with
additional financing in FY11), and the government wishes to further ensure coordination through a
SWAp arrangement. The program has already brought over 600,000 people improved water and
sanitation services and is committed to supplying 2.2 million people before it ends in 2015—it was
scaled up with significant additional financing in FY11. A water, urban development, and municipal
services AAA is proposed for later in the CAS period to support the national city development and
slum upgrading program (being planned with support from Cities Alliance) and the drafting of City
Development Strategies in a number of cities. Malawi is expected to continue to urbanize rapidly at
an estimated 5.3 percent annually (one of the highest rates in the world, though from a very low
base), yet the country is ill-prepared to manage the change. At the current rate, by 2050 Malawi’s
urban population would balloon by 48 percent.

Results Area: Lowering vulnerability and enhancing resilience

Outcome 2.2: Improved resilience for poor communities through adequate social safety nets,
improved climate resilience, and enhanced capacity to respond to disaster risks

93.     During the CAS period, the WBG will help to reinforce and rationalize Malawi’s social
support programs into a coherent productive social safety net system to protect the extreme
poor (both urban and rural), especially during natural disasters and other shocks. The WBG advice
will be in line with the World Bank Global Social Protection and Labor Strategy and the Africa
Social Protection Strategy, helping to design a comprehensive and equitable social protection system
that will guide Malawi’s most vulnerable people in becoming more resilient to shocks, including
climate changes, and to create better opportunities for the poor. Built on Malawi’s new Social
Support Policy, approved in 2012, and on more than 10 years of experience in social support
programs through the Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF), a comprehensive social support and
safety net system should provide cost-effective social welfare and care to marginalized groups, such
as the disabled and especially vulnerable children, and support active labor market and employment
programs.

94.    In support of the bold economic stabilization program Malawi initiated in April and
May 2012, the Bank in July 2012 approved a US$150 million Rapid Response Program (RRP)
comprising a Rapid Response Development Policy Grant (RRDPG) and two additional financing
                                            35
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
operations: the Malawi Social Action Fund 3 (MASAF 3 APL II) and the Rural Livelihood and
Agriculture Development Project (IRLADP). Both MASAF and IRLAD are active, expanding their
programs and helping to mitigate the impact on vulnerable households of the legacy of inflationary
pressures and economy rebalancing. Assistance to both rural and urban vulnerable households (by
expanding labor-intensive public works) and poor farming communities (by scaling up support to
productive rural livelihoods through irrigation) increases the incomes of a large number of
households, enabling them to better manage shocks and to build household assets. The Bank will
also, through a proposed AAA, conduct IEs of the MASAF 3 APL II Public Works Program;
disseminate the recommendations of the targeting study, which includes establishing a harmonized
social safety net system, a unified targeting strategy, including policy to harmonize targeting across
programs; and update the 2001 Social Safety Net Review to inform preparation of MASAF 4
(FY15). The Bank will continue to use its programs to leverage resources, as it did for MASAF 3
APL II: AfDB is now supporting the project’s economic program for the poor under the Community
Savings and Investment Program. Other DPs working with the Bank are UNICEF, Irish Aid, DfID,
the EU, and KfW.

95.      While Bank-financed projects are already supporting sustainable land and water
management and conservation agriculture (ASWAp-SP, IRLAD, NWDP II, Shire River Basin
Management Project), the approach today is to put in place a more integrated sustainable
development portfolio of investments that consolidate the ecological, economic, and social
dimensions of sustainability. Planned CAS projects will explore new mechanisms to integrate the
activities of current projects. This is reflected in the targeting of basin and regional development
planning, coupled with recognition of the need to better share knowledge and to monitor and evaluate
aggregate impacts in order to link micro, meso, and macro planning areas. Specifically, the WBG is
working to improve rural livelihoods and natural resources management nationally and regionally in
critical catchments through the Shire River Basin Management Project (FY12) as well as through
agriculture investments as part of the ASWAp program. Projects specifically targeting biodiversity
and natural habitats are the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve Project
and the GEF Nyika Trans-Frontier Conservation Area Project. National management and investment
will be considered in regional dialogue on better management of shared resources in the Shire and
Lake Basins (linking where appropriate with Zambezi Basin cooperation initiatives). The additional
financing approved for the IRLAD Project, will not only expand the social safety net through rural
investments in resilience, largely by expanding mini-scale irrigation nationwide through the inputs-
for-assets subprogram wide, it will also help prepare the way for similar new investments.

96.     Assistance will focus on both being better prepared for and mitigating vulnerabilities to
climate change and disaster risks. The Malawi Disaster Risk Management program (outlined in the
Country DRM Plan and the multi-donor National Climate Change Program) will address climate and
disaster risk challenges through a mix of analytic work, lending, and technical assistance. DRM will
focus on support for realization of an Action Plan for Integrated Flood Risk Management in the Shire
Valley, enhanced capacity for damage and loss assessments, disaster risk financing, and capacity to
deal with seismic risk. The focus for climate change adaptation will be on assessing the potential and
requirements for Malawi to access carbon finance, analyzing the contribution that better land and
forest management could make to both climate mitigation and adaptation, making climate
                                                  36
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
information more widely available, and weather forecasting. Support will increasingly go to
mainstreaming the findings of analytical and advisory tasks through the WBG’s lending portfolio.
The WBG will also seek opportunities for follow-up climate and DRM financing through Bank-
managed trust funds, cooperation with DPs, and regional initiatives. In particular, the Shire River
Basin Management Project provides opportunities for improving climate and disaster resilience; it is
concerned with both flood and land management issues in the Shire, where certain areas have some
of the highest climate-related disaster risks in the country. The project is expected to partly finance
the Action Plan for Integrated Flood Risk Management and to apply lessons from assessments of the
Climate Change Program and activities related to catchment management and strengthening
hydromet systems.

       Theme 3: Mainstreaming Governance for Enhanced Development Effectiveness
Results Areas and Outcomes:
Results Area: Improving public sector management systems
·      Outcome 3.1: Improved public sector performance because of better PFM, procurement, and
M&E systems and enhanced statistics
Results Area: Strengthening social accountability for service provision
·      Outcome 3.2: Enhanced transparency on resource flows and service delivery

97.     The governance arrangements that underpin service delivery are central to the ability
to effectively design and implement the CAS. The WBG will provide support to strategies for
improving governance in order to enhance development effectiveness. This theme comprises a cross-
cutting effort to help strengthen both supply-side and demand-side institutions, with an emphasis on
mainstreaming enhanced governance across the portfolio. The supply side comprises governance
mechanisms through which the government organizes itself to deliver on the strategy. On the demand
side, the CAS adopts strategic incrementalism, targeting entry points where there are client demand
and alliances for change and piloting smaller local initiatives and scaling them up as demand for
them emerges. This takes into account previous results that demonstrate that gains in this area come
incrementally and depend on client demand, and the WBG will respond to recent government
engagement on these issues. The demand side comprises the macro- and micro- institutional
arrangements that assure accountability, especially arrangements that facilitate citizen engagement in
design, implementation, and oversight. This will include a context analysis for selecting demand-side
governance instruments aligned with the political context and space to ensure that the instruments are
tailored to the country’s governance and operating environment.

Results Area: Improving public sector management systems

Outcome 3.1: Improved public sector performance because of better PFM, procurement, and
M&E systems and enhanced statistics systems

98.     The WBG is stepping up partnerships with DPs and the government to further refine
Malawi’s PFM system. The government has put in place a medium-term Public Finance and
Economic Management Reform Program (PFEM RP) covering a broad range: planning and policy
analysis, resource mobilization, budgeting, procurement, accounting and financial management, cash
and debt management, parastatal financing, reporting, auditing, and PFEM RP administration. A
common-basket support mechanism has been designed; the MDTF will be administered by the IDA
and executed by the government. During the CAS period, the Bank will work with the government to
strengthen its procurement management capacity, transparency, and accountability and monitor large
contracts in the eight top-spending ministries and departments (Agriculture, Education, Health,
Transport and Public Works, Irrigation and Water Development, ESCOM, the Roads Authority, and
the Malawi Housing Corporation). The Bank will further assist the government, especially the Office
of the Director of Public Procurement, to reinforce M&E of public procurement, complaint handling
systems in all procuring entities, and contract management capabilities; pilot independent contract
monitoring by CSOs; carry out on-site training courses for procurement staff; institutionalize

                                                 38
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
procurement planning as part of the budget process; and prepare simple bidding documents for local
government and community procurement.

99.      Through both lending and non-lending TA to support implementation of a government-
wide, results-oriented M&E system, the WBG will enhance the linkages between strategic
planning and M&E across sectors. It will also promote M&E transparency by expanding access to
information. The intent is to build demand for and effective supply and use of M&E information by
institutionalizing use of M&E across government. To do so the WBG will support design of a
government-wide M&E system that is technically feasible and not overly complex and that will be
built incrementally as demand arises, accompanied by the necessary capacity-building. Support for
M&E and government transparency and accountability will also entail better statistics, particularly in
terms of data quality. The government is preparing a new statistical development strategy and needs
support for its application, mainly through donor harmonization (basket financing, e.g., with
Norway). The strategy is expected to be translated into a statistical action plan that is timed,
budgeted, and actionable and clearly identifies a small number of major objectives: e.g., introduction
of the new System of National Accounts 2008 standard (SNA08); upgrading of NSO software and
hardware to better manage application of the new standards; and provision of constant online access
to major regional and international statistical resources. A variety of issues will then be jointly
addressed through a possible Public Sector Performance Project (FY14), which could include support
for reinforcing performance of the civil service, M&E, and statistics.

100. WBG engagement will include analytical work on public sector management, both
cross-cutting and by sector. Following up on country- and sector-wide political economy analysis
undertaken as part of the previous CAS, the 5th CAS proposes both cross-cutting and sectoral
political economy work on such topics as decentralization, mining, and the Nacala railway corridor.
This will include sector-specific work on governance, based on risk assessments. Regarding
decentralization, AAA will work on design and implementation of a solid fiscal and institutional
framework, exploring options tailored to the current Malawi context on the basis of international
good practices, lessons learned, progress made, and continuing challenges. Depending on
government demand, the WBG and other DPs will again support capacity-strengthening activities to
enhance both central and local capacity for efficiency, transparency, and accountability and the
capacity to put in place social safety nets. Support for decentralization might be provided through
lending (e.g., through the public sector performance project) or non-lending TA and analytical work
to support decentralization policy. An FY13 policy on decentralization in Malawi recommends
seizing the opportunity provided by the Local Development Fund to put in place a well-designed
capital transfer plan to improve service delivery, set local management incentives, and institute a
demand-driven, well-targeted, and performance-oriented system.

Results Area: Strengthening social accountability for service provision

Outcome 3.2: Enhanced transparency on resource flows and service delivery

101. The CAS will mainstream initiatives to enhance transparency across current and new
WBG-financed operations, using demand-side governance tools to the extent feasible. On the
basis of work done (see annex 8) and further reflections on lessons learned, mechanisms will be
selected at the beginning of the CAS period through a context analysis for demand-side governance
that examines the conceptual framework for social accountability. It will examine not only previous
social accountability experiences and lessons learned but also the political economy context for
demand-side governance. It will also evaluate new social accountability mechanisms, their benefits
and risks, and their potential for helping achieve CAS goals; their fiscal, institutional, and social
impact; potential for demonstration effects; and potential for being scaled up to enhance the
sustainability of program interventions in line with local, national, and international lessons learned.

102.     Demand-side governance instruments will be piloted first, mainly at the local and
sector levels, and then gradually be scaled up in line with government interest. Preliminary
methods to enhance the transparency of resource flows might include mechanisms that produce and
make available to citizens and users (on an annual basis) information on (i) the magnitude of
budgetary transfers to front-line service units and local governments; (ii) the obligations and
commitments of government in terms of services citizens should expect; and (iii) actual performance
of front-line service units, in a form that facilitates comparison both across units and relative to
announced obligations. This area will include support for budget transparency, independent budget
analysis, citizens’ charters, and possibly sectoral Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS). To
pave the way for a positive contribution to Malawian development from the mining sector and
mitigate the well-known risks that inadequate natural resource management poses for development
generally, the WBG will make a particular effort to support transparency and an enabling
environment generally in the mining sector (see Box 5).

103. Demand-side mechanisms have already been incorporated into the WBG portfolio to
enhance civil society and user participation, with a view to increasing transparency and
accountability. This has been particularly important when governance and growth cycles have been
changing quite radically. Box 6 lists social accountability initiatives currently being implemented and
Annex 8 sets out plans for the future. Demand-side governance interventions would benefit from
better design and more concern for implementation and would in particular benefit from scaling up
so that over time they can be truly mainstreamed. Careful M&E of demand-side governance
interventions would also help heighten the impact as these interventions are expanded and
institutionalized.

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
             Box 5: WBG Support for Mining Sector Governance Reform and Capacity Building

Sustainable growth of the mineral sector from its present relatively low-base is not assured but is possible if geology
campaigns and exploration reveal more resources and projects currently in the pipeline qualify for investment
decision in the medium term. Indeed, if commodity prices remain high and the recent dynamism in infrastructure
development is confirmed, a few mining projects could become viable. International experience shows that the right
frameworks and capacities need to be in place so that when the time comes, the sector will realize its potential
positive contribution in terms of both fiscal receipts and non-fiscal linkages. Otherwise the sector may have negative
economic, environmental, or social impacts, as demonstrated by the well-documented “resource curse.?

To support mining sector management, the Bank program comprises a US$31 million TA project co-financed in
FY11 by an IDA credit and a European Development Fund (EDF) grant, the objective of which is to improve the
efficiency, transparency, and sustainability of mining sector management. The project supports government
improvement in (i) management of mineral rights and operations; (ii) generation and management of mineral
revenues; and (iii) knowledge and promotion of national mineral resources.

In practice, the first phase of the project will include the following:
• Installation of a modern computer-based system to address transparency in mineral licensing
• Develop a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) that make it possible to closely analyze the
     environmental and social challenges of mining and how they are addressed by policies and institutions
• Finance a countrywide airborne geophysics survey and reinforce the Geological Surveys Department, where
     such information will be open and accessible to all interested parties. Providing access to geological information
     will promote transparency in knowledge and use of Malawi’s natural resources.
• Offer capacity-building support to key agencies, such as the Ministry of Finance and the Revenue Authority, on
     royalty and tax collection, revenue forecasting, and management of the resulting fiscal flows.

In parallel, the WBG is also encouraging stakeholders to engage more fully in the sector through formalized
arrangements for monitoring policy implementation and through support for revenue transparency via the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), with funding from the EITI-MDTF. In addition, South-South learning to
link revenue from mining to human development will be encouraged.


104. To enhance transparency wherever feasible the CAS will mainstream across the range
of WBG-financed operations and non-lending work mechanisms that (i) create opportunities for
users of services to participate in planning, implementation, and oversight of how public resources
allocated to service delivery are actually used; and (ii) facilitate sharing of information, especially
since there is no Access to Information Law to make such sharing easier. Mechanisms for
disseminating information should empower beneficiaries and oversight institutions while building
government capacity to make information accessible. Such mechanisms include citizens and
community scorecards (already piloted under the MASAF), participatory planning and budgeting
exercises, and other social accountability mechanisms. Selected instruments could include the use of
ICT to elicit feedback on user satisfaction with service delivery, such as social media platforms for
independent complaint and redress mechanisms; Public-Private Dialogue fora, along the lines of
those that IFC has successfully sponsored in several other African countries; support to the media by
training investigative journalists; and support for transparency, oversight, and feedback mechanisms
to bring citizen concerns more forcefully into the public sphere. Complementing this demand-side
governance work, the WBG will support, with assistance of WBI and other units, building capacity


                                                          41
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
for supporting parliaments and other oversight institutions to complement informal civil society
social accountability.

                   Box 6: Social Accountability Initiatives in the Current WBG Program

   There have been significant gains in incorporating transparency and citizen participation into Malawi’s
   development programs. For example, important social accountability initiatives within WBG-supported
   programs include:

   •   The use of Community Score Cards (CSCs) and Citizen Report Cards by the Malawi Social Action Fund.
   •   Within the IRLADP irrigation project, Water Users’ Associations are established and built up to fully
       engage water users in system management and control of the schemes, including financial management,
       and are empowered to engage in monitoring construction progress and quality.
   •   Civil society participates in joint annual and semi-annual reviews of the national response to HIV and
       AIDS where technical, financial management, procurement, and grants facility progress are discussed.
   •   Under the Nutrition & HIV/AIDS Project, NGOs will be active in community mobilization through
       contractual arrangements between the central Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS, and the District
       Council and NGOs.
   •   The School Management Committees are responsible, with the head teacher, for submitting school
       improvement plans to district assemblies for inclusion in District Education Plans, as well as for
       management of school grants.
   •   Civil society and communities have an explicit role in planning within the Shire River Basin Management
       Program through the Shire River Basin Stakeholder Forum, discussing issues affecting the basin and
       proposing management solutions. Also, catchment and flood risk management activities are giving NGOs a
       key role in both implementation with communities and in process and output monitoring.
   •   The Construction Sector Transparency (CoST) Initiative phase I, assisted by the Bank, supports publication
       of information on procurement and fulfillment of construction contracts, allowing the media and civil
       society to take a more active role in monitoring them. Malawi will also participate in phase II of this
       initiative.
   •   Representatives of transport infrastructure users and civil society participate in the Transport Joint Sector
       Review meetings.
   •   Communities will define priorities for community roads to be improved in the road component of the
       ASWAp.

C.          Implementing the FY13-FY16 WBG Country Assistance Strategy

105. The WBG is proposing an indicative financing envelope of US$695 million 17 over the
four years to support engagements under this CAS. Indicative lending and ESW programs are
included in Annex 10 and 11 respectively. The amounts shown in outer years are indicative only.
Actual allocations will depend on (i) the country's own performance; (ii) its performance relative to
other IDA recipients; (iii) the total amount of resources available to IDA; (iv) any changes in the list
of IDA-eligible countries; (v) terms of the financial assistance provided (grants or loans); and (vi) the
amount of compensatory resources received from MDRI. Despite HIPC debt relief, Malawi is
vulnerable to moderate debt distress and external shocks even as it attempts to diversify its export
base. Furthermore, the IDA program could be adjusted in case of policy slippages and a slowing pace
of reforms, particularly through the sizing and timing of the DPOs in close consultation with the
Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS). Support for proposed sectoral SWAps is also
contingent on reaching agreement on strategies with DPs and the government.

Portfolio Issues

106. The Malawi portfolio has reached record commitment values. The World Bank portfolio
in Malawi currently contains 13 investment projects with about US$970 million already committed
and US$651 million in undisbursed balances. By the end of FY13 the Bank will have a relatively
young portfolio, comprised of 10 active projects (see Table 3 for the portfolio trend). Previous
portfolio performance has been relatively strong in Malawi. There have been no problem projects for
the past three years, notwithstanding the difficult economic and political environment. Except in
FY12 disbursements have been above those for the Africa Region. The first few months of FY13
suggest a return to disbursement levels of above 20 percent. Performance of the portfolio has
improved since the last major CPPR in 2010, with 6 of the 13 projects rated as Satisfactory in terms
of Development Objectives (DOs) and Implementation Progress (IP), and only 3 projects with both
DOs and IPs rated just Moderately Satisfactory. The other four projects have either the DO or the IP
rated Satisfactory and the other Moderately Satisfactory.

107. Most of the outcomes of this CAS will be achieved by continuing the current portfolio.
The number of active projects is expected to remain constant at 10 from January 2013 on (see table
3). Three projects are closing this year and no new one will be added. The envisaged additional
financing for FSTAP will not affect the number of projects in the portfolio. In FY13 new entrants are
expected to match the number of exits.

108. The WBG supports the harmonization agenda with, for example, the use of national
procurement procedures for over 60 percent of procurement for IDA projects (subject to
exceptions related to fraud and corruption clauses) and also supports the mainstreaming of project
management units (PMUs) in government structures (e.g., ASWAp, ESWAp, mining, energy and
Shire River Basin Management Projects being implemented without PIUs). Between 2010 and May
2012, Bank and IFC-supported projects in Malawi ran into problems related to cost overruns, poor
contract administration, procurement delays, lack of readiness for implementation, fuel and foreign
exchange shortages, and funding delays for local project components. The WBG will address these
issues during the new CAS by moving toward more programmatic operations (which worked well
during the last CAS); using country systems where capacity exists or can be strengthened;
simplifying project design; using additional financing mechanisms to reduce transaction costs and
preparation time; improving readiness for implementation; ensuring more realistic covenants; helping
the government to move away from the PIU implementation model, and periodically reviewing the
portfolio with the government. The WBG now has better access to local technical support with the
establishment of the WBG/AfDB Joint Infrastructure Unit. The WBG will also consider using
innovative instruments like the P4R (Program for Results) where appropriate, maybe in higher
education and perhaps output-based aid (OBA) in areas such as nutrition, water and sanitation
services, and social protection.

109. The fiduciary risk of the portfolio as a whole is high due to (a) inadequate accounting
controls; (b) inadequate audit committees in government ministries and failure to follow up on audit
issues; and (c) low implementation capacity. The report on the Assessment of Fiduciary Risks in the
Use of Country PFM system for Investment Projects (2010) concluded that key elements to move
toward substantial use of the country PFM system for investment lending projects are present but
need to be refined. This includes integration of WBG-funded investment lending projects into the
planning and budget processes, appropriation, expenditure control, funds flow, accounting, and
reporting through the IFMIS and internal and external audit arrangements. The PFEMRP, supported
through the MDTF, will address some of these deficiencies. The fiduciary framework is adequate for
using country PFM systems for development policy operations (DPOs). The fiduciary team will be
cautious in increasing use of country FM systems. The team will analyze the risks and institute
mitigation measures for each element of the FM systems before using them. The Financial Reporting
and Oversight Improvement (FROI) Project funded through the PFEMRP MDTF is expected to go
into operation soon, which should address some of the current concerns in the portfolio. The WBG
team will also provide support to government financial management staff in projects in the portfolio
to build their capacity to maintain reliable records and submit properly reconciled reports for

                                                   44
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
monitoring and disbursement purposes. On the procurement side, an Institutional Development Fund
(IDF) is enhancing the skills of staff involved in procurement in Malawi’s ministries, departments,
and parastatal organizations and the capacity of the Office of the Director of Public Procurement
(ODPP) and of third party organizations to monitor procurement activities.

110. The governance mainstreaming approach laid out in Theme 3 of this CAS can only be
effective if it is given priority across all operations by the full Malawi country team. The WBG
programs that have emphasized governance in the CAS and the resulting mainstreaming of
governance throughout operations have found it useful to establish a Governance Advisory
Committee within the country team. The Malawi team has such a committee, led by the Country
Manager, as a cornerstone of CAS implementation. The Advisory Committee (i) provides guidance
on the governance strategy for Malawi; (ii) offers guidance on operational design in terms of
understanding and addressing governance constraints, such as by incorporating components to
enhance the transparency of sectoral resource flows and service delivery, and enhance civil society
participation in and oversight of service provision; (iii) reviews and clears project documents; (iv)
facilitates efforts to mainstream governance into operations along the above lines; and (v) monitors
progress on the governance strategy to build transparency, participation, and oversight across the
portfolio.

111. The CAS will support an AAA program (ESW, non-lending TA, and IEs) to underpin
the financing activities, fill in knowledge gaps, update diagnostics, and stimulate innovations
and pilots drawing on country and global experience. Following the harmonization principles and
drawing on the lessons of the CAS Completion Report and client consultations, research and analysis
will be done in close cooperation with country counterparts, development partners, and local
academics and researchers to reinforce joint ownership and build capacity. The strategic use of trust
funds will enhance the scope and depth of the analytical and advisory work. An IDF grant is
supporting the government’s efforts to enhance capacity to mobilize the Malawian diaspora for
economic development and build remittances. The WBG will also participate in joint evaluations led
by other DPs, as is the case for the DfID-funded impact evaluation of the FISP. The WBG is part of
the technical committee in charge of supervising the evaluation that will design and draft a panel
survey based on the IHS3 to measure the impact of the FISP on household productivity and incomes,
on maize and labor market changes, on fertilizer and seed markets, and more globally on the general
economy. The WBG has also been advancing the knowledge-sharing agenda by engaging non-
traditional partners through south-south knowledge and peer-to-peer learning programs; for instance,
it recently organized a video conference where officials from the Reserve Bank of Malawi financial
education unit were able to learn from their Brazilian counterparts about Brazil’s successful program
of financial education in schools.

112. The CAS objectives and the results will be achieved with a concerted and integrated
WBG approach. Delivering the bulk of the agenda will require synergistic collaboration and
coordinated complementary activities of the Bank, IFC, and MIGA (as needed). Close partnership
between the Bank and IFC will be particularly important to improving the business climate,
diversifying the economic and export base, enabling PPPs to meet investment gaps and deliver better
infrastructure services, meeting the financial needs of individuals and enterprises (including Micro,
                                                  45
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
Small and Medium Enterprise (MSMEs)), expanding emerging sectors and businesses, and
maximizing the potential of greater global and regional integration. The IFC’s Global Trade Finance
Program (GTFP) has been active in Malawi, working to expand available financing with longer
maturities to reduce the need for collateralized transactions. Its focus has been in the financial, agro-
processing, and telecom sectors. MIGA also remains open for business in Malawi, across all of its
Political Risk Insurance product lines, including Transfer Restriction, Expropriation, Breach of
Contract and War and Civil Disturbance, as well as the Non-Honoring of Sovereign Obligations.
These product lines can be used alongside other WBG products, for example, IFC loans or PRG
support, or to directly support government public private partnerships or Independent Power Projects,
as has been applied elsewhere in the region. MIGA's Small Investment Product (SIP) could also be
useful for the country, where more streamlined procedures could allow smaller projects to be
supported. WBI will have a critical role in building capacity, disseminating global best practices, and
building the knowledge base of counterparts in such areas as budgeting and PFM reforms, public
investment planning and management, project analysis and implementation, and poverty and sectoral
assessments and strategy development.

                                     Box 7: World Bank / IFC Collaboration

IDA and IFC have a strong partnership and intend to step up the collaboration in the improved private investment
environment. IFC is seeking to increase its engagement in Malawi, focusing on investments and advisory activities
that help diversify the economy; develop the micro, small and medium Enterprise (MSME) sector; and improve
access to finance. IDA and IFC teams have been exploring joint initiatives and are working closely together in areas
such as improving the business environment, access to finance for SMEs, agro-processing and commercial
agriculture, telecoms, PPP support, and facilitation of global trade integration. Some highlights of this collaboration:

    •    IFC’s Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) in Malawi seeks to (expand available financing and reduce
         the need for cash collateralized transactions; (b) provide longer maturities than currently available; and (c)
         deliver technical assistance and training to improve operating standards. Its Small and Medium Enterprises
         Enterprise Development Initiative (SME-EDI) worked with the Malawi Export Promotion Council (MEPC)
         on a countrywide sector mapping exercise to identify SME export opportunities, and on production of an
         SME exporter handbook, completed in November 2008.

    •    For the Shire Valley Irrigation Project (FY16), in 2011 a joint identification mission from IFC/IDA/AfDB
         drafted with the government a roadmap and identified principles of engagement on this large-scale
         irrigation- based agricultural growth pole project. It encompasses a comprehensive support package
         directed at both the public and the private sector, with specific support for value chain and agribusiness
         development. Preparatory studies are being proposed under the CAS looking specifically at the investment
         climate, regional agribusiness opportunities, linkages of producers to markets, and access to finance; and
         these are pursued in a direct collaboration between IDA/IFC and the AfDB. Also on irrigation service
         provision and the large public and private investments required for infrastructure and O&M, options have
         been explored for PPPs and joint support from IDA, IFC, and also MIGA.

    •    Also in agriculture sector in general, as a complement of World Bank support to the ASWAp-supported
         reform agenda, IFC through its Investment Climate (IC) Advisory Services may provide technical
         assistance to improve the functioning of markets serving agribusiness, including addressing legal barriers to
         competition in and expansion of commercial agriculture all along the value chain: input markets, systems
         for contract farming and aggregation, management of storage and logistics, cross-border trade, and taxation
         issues.
                                                          46
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16

   •   In both of these initiatives, IFC’s experience in investment promotion and facilitation could help attract
       reputable investors. This could be done with support for the technology, quality standards, and market
       access necessary to make the sector more competitive and build the capacity of smallholders to handle out-
       grower schemes.



113. Trust funds (TF) are an integral part of the Malawi portfolio and contribute to
achievement of CAS goals. The current strategy of closely linking TFs with planned financial
support will continue, with a program designed to address analytical gaps and provide TA essential
to achievement of the CAS outcomes. TFs have also been effectively used to help Malawi pilot
initiatives and respond to changing country conditions (as in disaster risk reduction and
management). A concrete example of the positive impact of trust-funded activities was when TA
under the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST) was used to draft a Financial
Sector Development Strategy for Malawi, which then led to a financial sector technical assistance
operation that is helping implement the strategy. Management of TFs will be mainstreamed within
the WBG’s CAS implementation strategy in areas such as procurement, financial management; and
M&E within an integrated portfolio monitoring and reporting system, which will ensure continuous,
follow up of activities. (See Annex 9 for a summary of current TFs.)

114. There are 30 DPs active in Malawi in a variety of sectors (see Annex 5). Actual official
development assistance (ODA) disbursements to Malawi between 2007/08 to 2009/10 amounted to
US$2.14 billion. In FY2009/10- 2010/2011, of the 30 DPs, the six largest as a percentage of ODA
were United States (US$206 million), the EU (US$ 154 million), the World Bank (US$139 million),
the United Kingdom - Department for International Development (DfID) (US$$108 million),
Norway (US$ 57 million), and the AfDB (US$ 36 million). The top five DPs contributed 70 percent
of Malawi ODA. The largest multilateral agency was the EU and the largest bilateral donor the
United States. The WBG, in close partnership with the government and other DPs, is committed to
the Paris Declaration for Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action. The MGDS framework
provides the basis for alignment of donor support to ensure greater ownership, emphasis on results, a
sharp poverty focus, harmonization, and mutual accountability. The WBG is moving toward more
programmatic lending arrangements with other DPs and already participates in one pooled funding
arrangement (the HIV and AIDS Pool) and is building similar arrangements in education, water, and
agriculture. Sector wide approaches (SWAp) and SWAp-like arrangements are pursued in nutrition
and education through co-financing arrangements such as MDTFs. An MDTF has already been
established for PFM reforms. The WBG plans to continue to provide and implement the DPOs
within the framework of the CABS, a group of DPs that have a common approach to provision of
budgetary support to the government. The Joint Framework signed in 2005 between the government
and the CABS DPs (EU, DfID, Norway, SIDA) sets forth agreed terms and procedures for budget
support and serves as a coordinating framework for consultation, joint reviews of performance, and
reporting. All CABS members have bilateral agreements with the government that guide their
individual financial decisions. Revision of the Joint Framework, initiated in 2010, is continuing.

115. The government has created sector working groups to coordinate and manage sector
activities and also a high-level forum for policy discussions. Within the harmonization framework,
                                                 47
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
the WBG will lead the sector working groups on Economic Governance, Management, Energy, and
Private Sector Development. It will play a co-lead role in partnership with others in agriculture and in
the sustainable development of irrigation and water resources. The Joint Infrastructure Unit will
facilitate collaboration with the government and other DPs in the Water and Transport working
groups and coordination of project preparation and implementation. Joint programs should decrease
transaction costs for all parties. The WBG is also contributing to a continuing effort to agree on joint
donor conclusions on development issues (Joint Country Analysis), spear-headed by the EU and
UNDP, which is expected to form a key input for the planned December 2012 planned high-level
meeting.

116. Effective collaboration with nontraditional partners in Malawi is still a work in
progress and during the first half of this CAS, efforts will be made to learn from the WBG-
wide experience in this area. Nevertheless, collaborative efforts between traditional and
nontraditional partners will be central to helping government deliver on its economic growth targets.
Currently coordination is within the context of the Heads of Mission dialogue platform, which is
open to both traditional and nontraditional partners. Although the share of nontraditional support in
total foreign support remains small, in recent years the presence in Malawi of nontraditional partners
(dominated by China and India) has been growing. Nontraditional partners are largely concentrated
in project financing, though PPPs and otherwise, and facilitating private investments on a
concessional basis as part of south-south cooperation. Over the past few years China’s support to the
Malawi government has included infrastructure investments (international conference facility,
National Parliament Building, Sciences and Technology University, Karonga-Chitipa Road,
expansion of Kapichira II and more recently launched the building of a national stadium now
underway). India has extended two lines of credit worth US$ 80 million for investments in
agriculture.

117. The gender focus of the WBG’s program is addressed explicitly in the CAS. In the CAS
the WBG has prioritized interventions that support (i) more equal enrollment and retention of boys
and girls in school: the CAS will support retention of girls in schools through conditional cash
transfers and school bursaries, and by improving education quality through providing clean and safe
sanitation for children attending school in specified project areas (e.g., the Project to Improve
Education Quality in Malawi, FY10); the Second National Water Development Project (FY07)); (ii)
more equal access to financial markets and land: project interventions will increase the number of
women with access to land and financial services by helping the government to increase access to
stronger financial markets and promote equity in land acquisition (e.g., Financial Sector Project;
Community Based Rural Land Development Project); and (iii) more income opportunities for rural
women: the CAS will support targets for raising agricultural productivity and improving the
livelihoods of poor and vulnerable rural households, including women, for example, by improving
access to agricultural inputs (e.g., seeds and fertilizers) and to income-generating activities (e.g.,
Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods and Agriculture Project; Third Social Action Fund; Shire Valley
Irrigation Project). The aim is to raise two of the indicators for mainstreaming gender in the country
portfolio. (See Annex 6, which has a separate monitoring framework for this gender mainstreaming
target). Moreover, this gender focus in operations is underpinned by a strong analytical work
program.

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16


118. In addition to mainstreaming impact evaluations, the program will be monitored and
outcomes evaluated regularly. A CAS Progress Report to be prepared for Board presentation in
2014 will reflect candid assessments of progress and address any major deviations or emerging
priorities. Annual Results Days will bring together the country team to take stock of progress and
discuss needed adjustments, corrections, and updates; the results framework will be used as a live
monitoring tool. The WBG will continue to have annual programming discussions with the Ministry
of Finance and Planning to review the CAS program.

IV. MANAGING RISKS

119. There are considerable risks to successful attainment of the results targeted in the
proposed CAS program. These stem from the political environment for sustained commitment to
the reform agenda, external and internal macroeconomic risks, weather-related shocks, risks from the
lack of diversity of the economy, and risks arising from inadequate public sector management
capacity and fiduciary and governance issues.

120. Political risks could affect macroeconomic stabilization. The current government has
embarked on bold reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and is committed to prudent
macroeconomic policies. However, risks might arise from tensions between political pressures to expand
government programs and the need for a prudent fiscal stance in order to keep inflation pressures at bay
and keep debt sustainable. The reform agenda may also be affected by the elections planned for 2014.
While there is likely to be continued political commitment to poverty reduction and implementation
of the MGDS II, in the past commitment to a credible macro stabilization program has wavered.
Some of the risks are mitigated by the deliberate government efforts to build broad public support for
policy reforms. In addition, the government’s efforts to enhance social inclusion through education,
health, and expanded social protection programs, supported by the Bank’s Rapid Response Program, are
expected to help offset potential social tension.

121. Shortfalls in donor support could undermine economic growth and the external balance.
A widening external financing gap could force the authorities to borrow domestically; given minimal
official reserves and significant import needs, that would put pressure on a difficult fiscal adjustment
process, undermine fiscal sustainability, and jeopardize necessary social and capital expenditures. These
risks are mitigated by the forceful actions the administration has already undertaken to repair relations
with DPs and its intentions to address governance and human rights concerns; its commitments to the
fiscal adjustment program and a flexible exchange rate policy, which anchor for external and debt
sustainability; and predictable and timely budget support backed by analytical support and policy
dialogue through the next DPO series.

122. Social tensions could mount, which would cause fiscal pressures. The consequences of
previous economic policies and recent adjustments in the economy could further push up consumer prices
and erode consumer purchasing power, which could stimulate wage demands in both the private and the
public sector and increase social tensions. Already there have been many labor disputes and some strikes
that affected service delivery and raised political concerns about the viability of the reform effort. These
                                                    49
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
tensions could be exacerbated if international increases in fuel prices result in second-round effects on the
prices of other products and further increase the costs of production, which would again raise prices.
Domestic tensions could affect investor and consumer confidence, which would deter private investment,
and could also increase fiscal pressures on government financing. There are provisions in the fiscal
framework as agreed with the IMF to deal with some of the demands, but it will be necessary for the
government to engage all stakeholders to rally support for reforms, understand the consequences, and
manage expectations. To mitigate this risk, the government will also need to make a deliberate and
comprehensive effort to clearly communicate the reform program, its impact, and the role of various
stakeholders, including citizens.

123. Malawi is still vulnerable to internal and external trade shocks. The lack of agricultural
diversification and arbitrary government interventions in agricultural markets, as well as weather-
related events (droughts, and also floods, are frequent), expose the economy to such shocks. Last
year, burley tobacco, the country’s main export crop, demonstrated disappointing performance, and
the sector is now threatened by enforcement of agreed components of the Framework Convention on
Tobacco, which would restrict, and possibly ban, the use of flavorants. Alternative livelihoods and
sources of export revenues are being explored, but effective diversification programs require a
supportive macro-environment and investment climate. It will also take time to establish effective
market conditions for alternative crops to take the place of tobacco. Non-agricultural diversification,
for instance mining, requires significant investments, which in turn will require government to
improve the business climate for private energy investors. The WBG, together with other DPs, will
continue to work closely with government counterparts to deal with the many structural barriers in
this transition process.

124. Climate variability and natural disasters continue to put strains on Malawi’s economy.
WBG assessments found that droughts and dry spells cause average annual losses of about 1 percent
of GDP and floods losses of about 0.7 percent. Given the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters,
coupled with their potentially significant impact on the economy, which could be exacerbated by
effects of climate change, the WBG is already scaling up support for climate and disaster risk
management and mainstreaming mitigation and adaptation within the portfolio. DPs are also
supporting adoption of a comprehensive risk mitigation and contingency plan for reducing Malawi’s
vulnerability to natural disasters.

125. Concerns about poor public sector management and governance persist. Implementation
of the CAS program and achievement of results could be undermined by inadequate public sector
management capacity and arrangements. Furthermore, highly centralized decision making and
centralization of powers affect decisions related to projects. Firming up the evidence base for
decision-making and collaboration on strategic decision-making through enhanced support for public
sector reform could mitigate this risk. Feeble public fiduciary management due to lack of capacity to
implement, account for, and report on expenditures at all levels, as well as limited capacity to
manage procurement, raise concerns about the governance aspects of projects. Recognizing these
weaknesses, the government has pronounced a “national austerity drive? to address some of them.
Several interventions, such as the Public Finance and Economic Management MDTF, are expected to
help address capacity challenges. The first project of the PFM RP is focusing on the government
                                                  50
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
accounting system (IFMIS), internal audits, and external audits. The intent is to improve the
timeliness and reliability of financial information; the control environment, by building up the
internal audit function to ensure enforcement of policies and procedures and prompt follow-up of
audit recommendations; and the external audit function to improve the range (through, e.g., forensic
and value-for-money audits) and quality of audits. This should partially mitigate the public fiduciary
management problem. Enhanced transparency of resource flows and service delivery, including
efforts to improve data quality and availability for results monitoring, coupled with enhanced civil
society participation and oversight, is also expected to help mitigate these risks. Extra vigilance in the
oversight of project funding allocations will be required.

I. INTRODUCTION

1.      The Malawi Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the
effectiveness of the Bank’s assistance program to Malawi for the period FY07-FY12. The CAS
was originally planned for FY07-10, but was extended due to delays in implementation of the
program caused by political economy problems and to allow full alignment of the new CAS with
the second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II). The conclusions of this report
will inform the new CAS to be delivered in FY13. This report benefited from (i) a review of the
link between the strategic objectives of the 2007-2012 CAS and government goals as formulated
in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy 2006/7-2010/11; (ii) a review of portfolio
performance and selected Bank documents and assessments carried out to date; (iii) a review of
the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group’s (QAG) reports on several projects in the portfolio; (iv)
updated outcome tables and inputs from the Country Team members; and (v) an assessment of
the extent to which the Bank was successful in meeting CAS objectives.

2.      The CASCR rates program implementation as moderately unsatisfactory due to limited
improvement in the business environment, especially the energy outcomes, failure to embark on
agriculture commercialization, and the deteriorating political economy and poor macroeconomic
management that affected project implementation, especially the last 18 months of CAS
implementation. It rates Bank performance as moderately satisfactory; the program demonstrated
uneven success in contributing to the achievement of all CAS outcomes. However, there is a
broadly sound program of ongoing activities in place for the next strategy period. Positive
aspects of Bank performance included a results-based and client-responsive CAS design,
proactiveness in dealing with implementation issues, and successfully replacing budget support
by investment lending at times of inappropriate macro-policies. The Bank’s program remained
responsive to the country’s changing environment and demands during the CAS period.

II. MALAWI’S LONGER-TERM STRATEGIC GOALS

3.     The MGDS sets out the Government’s economic growth and development priorities for
five years (2006/07 – 2010/11), in line with the longer term Vision 2020 and the Millennium
Development Goals. The MGDS built on the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (2002) and
Economic Growth Strategy (2003) and integrated several new sector strategies, policies, and
emerging issues, such as land reform and public-private partnerships.

4.     The July 2010 MGDS review commissioned by the Malawi Government and financed by
UNDP indicated that the MGDS has generally been an effective instrument for achieving the
country’s development goals. Through this strategy some challenges, such as food insecurity and
                                              65
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
dwindling of income, have been reversed, resulting in positive economic growth. However,
performance in areas such as poverty reduction, elimination of extreme hunger, gender parity,
universal access to primary education, maternal health, and employment generation is still
disappointing. There are also structural challenges, such as weak harmonization between overall
strategies and implementation of specific policies at the ministerial level, and weak monitoring
and evaluation systems.

5.     In 2007, an IMF/World Bank Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) concluded that the
MGDS provided a comprehensive framework for growth and poverty reduction in Malawi, but
also pointed out that the results framework was weak. Staff noted that the emphasis on growth
and government ownership were key strengths of the strategy, while the results framework was
not underpinned by a comprehensive list of indicators that allowed for effective monitoring and
evaluation. The role of social protection and expenditures protection in supporting growth was
also underplayed.

6.      The JSAN recommended additional analytical work that was necessary to achieve MGDS
objectives. These included growth diagnostics; analytical work to improve the quality of the
governance environment (efficiency, accountability, and transparency in the use of public
resources); diagnostic work to better understand the underlying constraints to evidence-based
policy making in Malawi; more detailed analytical work on barriers and facilitators to infant and
child feeding as a main contributor to malnutrition; institutional audit to inform efforts to build a
stronger disaster management system; and efforts to further scale up weather insurance policies.

III. CAS OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES

7.     The 2007 CAS identified three key challenges to achievement of the Government’s
development goals:

   •   Pervasive risks at the national and household level resulting primarily from food
       insecurity caused by weather-related shocks to agricultural production and poorly
       functioning agricultural markets, macroeconomic instability, and illness or death,
       especially from HIV/AIDS.

   •   Constraints in private sector development because of macroeconomic instability,
       deficient infrastructure, especially limited and unreliable electricity supply, a shortage of
       skilled personnel, expensive and restricted access to credit, and the negative impact of
       crime and corruption.

   •   Weak institutional capacity: Malawi faces severe human resource constraints in key
       sectors, including health and education, partly due to the inability of the education
       system to produce sufficient graduates, exacerbated by the impact of the HIV/AIDS.

8.     Responding to the key development challenges identified by the World Bank, the 2007
CAS set four pillars with outcomes directly linked to the MGDS goals. The milestones for
monitoring progress were centered on key issues that the Bank program sought to address
through expected CAS outcomes (see Figure 1).

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
9.      The CAS was also aligned with the Bank’s African Region strategic priorities. The focus
of the CAS on growth, enhanced social protection, and improved governance reflected the four
pillars of the Africa Action Plan (AAP, adopted in September 26, 2005): accelerating shared
growth; building capable states; strengthening outcome-based national strategies and the Bank’s
focus on results; and strengthening the global development partnership for Africa.




10.     Implementation of the CAS and progress of reforms were strongly influenced by
political, social, and economic developments in Malawi during the period. Program
implementation gave more preference to economic growth than has been the case in the past, in
line with Malawi’s substantial progress in pursuing sustainable fiscal policies and maintaining
macroeconomic stability for a number of years. The country’s macroeconomic performance was
affected by various shocks and the level of fiscal discipline, which tended to oscillate between
periods of strong (2006–2008 and 2010) and weak policy implementation (2011/12). The year
2006 marked a return to macroeconomic stability and fiscal prudence with 7.7 percent growth in
real GDP after an era of weak macroeconomic performance and lackluster economic growth,
averaging 2 percent.

IV. RESULTS ASSESSMENT

Program Performance Rating

The CAS Completion report rates the achievement of results foreseen in the CAS as moderately
unsatisfactory because it did not make acceptable progress toward several of its major expected
outcomes. The program was delivered as planned with minor modifications to scheduling but
within an expanded implementation period and more resources as compared to the plan. The
most important shortcoming was the failure to address issues in the energy sector which is today
still a major constraint to investment. The Bank contributed to the development of SWAps in the
education and agriculture sectors as a means of addressing Government capacity constraints and
pooled funds with other development partners to address the issues of vulnerability as a result of
HIV infections and food insecurity. DPLs were provided in the context of the Common
Approach to Budget support and were linked to the investment lending, in turn preceded in most
cases      by      AAAs.        Some      of    the     notable      results    achieved       are
(a) harmonization of agriculture and education sector investments and a close alignment of
support toward Government sector programs; (b) setting the analytical basis for Government to
make informed evidence-based policy decisions in order to focus on priorities that can enhance
the impact on growth and poverty reduction; (c) support Government to implement innovative
agricultural risk management models on macro- and micro-weather insurance schemes; The
implementing environment characterized by a challenging policy environment and a fragile
economy contributed to underperformance. Areas of concern included these areas: limited
improvement of the business environment aggravated by the static energy agenda; delayed
implementation of reforms; and the deteriorating political economy.

11.     The political stalemate between the former president and the opposition hampered the
Government’s ability to legislate. This affected progress of implementation of agreed reforms,
including meeting several covenants, 19 and ratification of a number of IDA credits. In 2008 and
2009 the policy-making environment remained constrained, compounded by the 2008/09 global
food and fertilizer price shocks and significant fiscal loosening that preceded the 2009 elections.
Consequently, although the 2007 CAS had planned to deliver three projects (HIV/AIDS, Energy,
and PRSG2) valued at $90 million in FY09, only one, the PRSG2, was delivered, with a limited
reform agenda and a correspondingly lower amount of budget support. IDA was able to deliver a
Regional Communication Infrastructure Project that was not originally planned. Some IDA-
Board approved projects were not ratified for a long period (including the Mozambique-Malawi
Interconnector and the Agriculture Development Support Project). Hence the Bank adopted a
roll-back strategy in 2009, which meant reduced lending and increased AAA.

12.     President Mutharika was re-elected in May 2009 and his Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) won an absolute majority in Parliament. This allowed for a smoother budget session than
in the previous years. Ratification of Bank credits, including ADP-SP and the additional
financing for the Multi HIV/AIDS project, was quicker. New operations, such as the PRSG III
and the Improving the Quality of Education Project, were rapidly processed. Additional
financing for MASAF III and IRLAD and new operations in the mining, environment, and
financial sectors were also approved. While the Regional interconnector project was cancelled

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
for lack of political support in Malawi, the energy dialogue picked up again, resulting in
preparation of a new energy investment project. Other investments in water, nutrition,
agriculture, and environment were approved in FY 11 and FY12. Because all of these activities
were still part of the original CAS program, the CAS implementation period was extended by
another year. This also allowed time to fully align the new CAS (FY13-16) with the
Government’s process to review the MGDS I and prepare for MGDS II, which was adopted in
May 2012.

13.     However, pressures were growing, political as well as economic. Malawi went into a
negative cycle of lost confidence, investment, and support. The inappropriate policy response to
shocks, including the terms of trade shock in early 2011, resulted in an off-track IMF Extended
Credit Facility. As a result, budget support from the Bank and other donors in the Common
Approach to Budget Support (CABS) came to a halt. In addition, the $350 million Millennium
Challenge Compact and budget support from CABS development partners were also suspended.
This resulted in foreign exchange and fuel shortages that slowed down the implementation of
many projects, especially in the infrastructure area. All these impacted the entire program, and at
least a year of implementation was lost.

14.     In April 2012 Mrs. Banda ascended to the presidency following the death of President
Mutharika. This opened a new window of opportunity; many pending important governance and
economic reforms were implemented within a short period, necessitating the preparation of a
Rapid Response program. An IMF-endorsed ECF program has been in place since July 2012. All
donors are back at the table. As there are still some concerns about effective parliamentary
oversight, civil society and faith-based organizations continue their watchdog and alternative
voice role.

V.   CAS IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES AT
THE END OF THE CAS PERIOD

Pillar 1: Agricultural productivity and integration into agro-processing

15.     The priority was to increase productivity and food security. Irrigation and market
incentives were expected to contribute to increased yields, specifically for smallholder farmers
supported by the Bank program. Through three projects—the Community Based Lands
Development Project (CBRLD); the Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods and Agricultural Development
Program (IRLADP); and the Agricultural Development Program-Support Project (ADP-SP that
later was folded into Agriculture SWAP)—the following had been achieved by June 2012:

 •   Increased productivity by targeted farmers for rain-fed maize from less than 1.0 t/ha to 1.9
     t/ha on average at the national level. Under irrigation, national statistics indicate that
     average maize and rice yield have increased to over 2.8 t/ha (from 1.6) and 1.5 t/ha (from
     1.0) respectively by 2012.
 •   More than 3,400 hectares of irrigated land have been developed or rehabilitated, benefitting
     over 20,000 households.
 •   15,142 land-poor rural households voluntarily relocated from densely populated districts to
     other districts with available arable land where they have realized improved food
     production and incomes. These beneficiaries now cultivate about 2 ha from an original land
     holding size of less than 0.5 ha.
                                                69
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
 •       More than 340,000 farming households are benefitting from on-farm trials and
         demonstrations of improved seed, crop nutrient management, sustainable land and water
         management techniques, and post-harvest technologies.

16.     However, much remains to be done to put agriculture in Malawi on a more diversified
and commercial-oriented footing. The Bank is still in the initial stages of work with the Ministry
of Agriculture and Food Security to develop a project to promote agricultural diversification and
more commercialized farming practices. The ASWAp-SP, has received additional financing for
construction of rural roads and to start initial investments on diversification (focusing on
legumes production). IRLADP has been extended and received additional finances of $52.7
million to scale up its support to small-scale irrigation schemes and implementation of inputs for
asset activities as a social safety net program to cushion the impact of the economic reforms in
rural areas. The Community Lands project closed in September 2012 and received a positive
evaluation from the IEG assessment
    .
Pillar 2: Improved business environment

17.     The program expected to achieve improvements in the efficiency and reliability of
electricity supply and in “Doing Business? indicators for increased trade across borders and
reductions in the costs to start a business. The major achievements were:

     •     The establishment of a Commercial Court in 2007 significantly reduced the number of
           days spent in settlement of commercial disputes from an average of 290 days in 2008 to
           96 days in 2010.

     •     Improvement of sector management and governance due to the establishment of the
           Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority (MERA) in 2008 and an increase in tariff levels by
           an average of 56 percent, which will strengthen the financial position of ESCOM.

     •     The Bank and European Commission have supported the preparation of a multimodal
           transport study and the Government is preparing a Transport Sector Investment Program.
           The condition of the road network has improved significantly, and the outlook for
           financing maintenance through road user charges is encouraging.

18.     However, no progress was made in improving the quality of electricity supply. The
quality of electricity remains the most serious constraint for businesses, as evidenced by load-
shedding, currently estimated to frequently exceed 30 mw, or 10 percent of peak demand. The
cancelled Mozambique-Malawi Interconnector Project to connect Malawi to the Southern
African Power Pool would have provided an alternative source of power pending development of
Malawi’s domestic power resources. A new Energy Sector Project was approved in FY11 and is
investing in rehabilitation and expansion of the current distribution and transmission system, as
well as in future generation and demand-side measures. The MCC Compact was delayed in
preparation, signed in 2011, but subsequently put on hold due to governance challenges until
June 2012. This US$350 million program, which complements the scope of the Bank-financed
energy project, is now beginning its implementation.

Pillar 3: HIV/AIDS and nutrition

19.     Behavior changes were expected in order to contribute to a slowing HIV infection rate
and an increased number of people on Anti-Retroviral (ARV) treatment. Government was
expected to develop a coherent program on improving the nutritional status of children of less
than 2 years of age. The following was achieved:

   •   Increased number of people living with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy (ART), from
       around 57,000 in 2006 to over 198,800 in 2010, exceeding the target of 165,000 set for
       2009. Similarly, the number of HIV testing and counseling sites increased from 14 in
       2001 to the 410.
   •   The HIV/AIDS infection rate decreased from 14 percent to 10.6 percent in 2012. This has
       contributed to the improvement in life expectancy from 30 in 2005 to 52 in 2012.

20.     Although a nationwide awareness and information campaign was undertaken to promote
good feeding practices for under-5 and school-age children, Malawi still lacks a coherent
nutrition program. A multi-partner study examining determinants of infant and child feeding
practices was completed and provided the basis for a nutrition program. Study results have been
widely disseminated and the Bank in collaboration with other partners prepared the Nutrition,
HIV and AIDS project, which was approved in FY 12.

Pillar 4: Sustain improvements in fiscal discipline

21.     Malawi was expected to achieve improvements in expenditure management as measured
by the public financial management (PEFA) indicators. Below are some major achievements
(details may be found in Attachment 2 of this report :

  •    Comprehensiveness and transparency of the budget: Government progressed in improving
       the linkage between the MGDS and the budget. Since 2008/09, Government introduced an
       output-based budget framework where ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) are
       now required to make their budgets according to MGDS priorities. Furthermore, the
       presentation and structure of the budget, together with the associated chart of accounts,
       have been improved to become compliant with international fiscal reporting standards
       (Government Financial Statistics (GFS) 2001), both for economic and program
       classifications. A module dealing with integrating the budget into the overall General
       Ledger in IFMIS has been introduced. MTEF was reinvigorated in 2011/12 and the budget
       process now focuses more on outputs and achievements.

  •    External audit and scrutiny: Progress has been made in improving the timeliness and
       coverage of audits. Government has since cleared the backlog of audits. While the audit of
       the 2009/10 financial statement was submitted within six months of the end of the fiscal
       year, the audit for the 2010/11 was submitted to Parliament with some delays.

  •    The key challenge in audit and external scrutiny is to make timely follow-ups of the audit
       issues raised by the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament. Government is expected to
       report on this in a Treasury Minute issued by the Ministry of Finance. There is still a
       backlog of these Treasury Minutes. In addition, beyond linking the budget to the MGDS,
       there is need to further strengthen institutional arrangements for budget implementation.
                                                 71
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
        For example, currently no budget planning margins are being provided within the MTEF
        ceilings to cater for additional expenditure requirements arising from new policy or
        programs.

V. BANK PERFORMANCE

Bank Performance Rating

The Completion Report rates Bank performance as moderately satisfactory, because the
implementation of the program demonstrated uneven success in contributing to the achievement
of CAS outcomes. However, there is a broadly sound program of ongoing activities in place for
the next strategy period. Positive aspects of bank performance included: (a) program design that
was selective, result focused, and responsive to Government requests and priorities, which
enhanced Government ownership; (b) proactive and timely streamlining of the portfolio through
the cancellation, closure, and restructuring of operations to ensure effective implementation,
including in some cases provision of additional financing for cost overruns and scaling–up of
successful interventions; (c) leveraging the Bank’s knowledge-generation capacity and
convening power to lead the delivery of lending and key knowledge products to help achieve the
objectives of both the CAS and the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy; (d) flexibility
and proactiveness that led to the adoption of a roll-back strategy that suited the implementation
environment in 2009; (e) successful steering Bank support from budget support to investment
support at times when macro-policies made budget support rather impossible; and (f) widening
and harnessing stakeholder participation, especially the private sector, CSOs, and media, which
improved the Bank’s image as per the 2010 client survey. However, the policy dialogue proved
difficult beyond the technical level and delayed the ratification of some of the policies.


A. Quality of Products and Services

22.     During the CAS period, the WBG’s program was selective based on government requests
and priorities. The program also targeted more realistic results in line with the key
recommendations of 2006 IEG CAE. The program limited the Bank’s engagement in sectors in
which other development partners are adequately positioned to take the lead, for instance, the
health sector. The portfolio was streamlined through the cancellation, closure, and restructuring
of operations to ensure effective implementation. The portfolio was reduced to about 10 projects
to allow budget space for critical knowledge work.

23.    The Bank has been leveraging its capacity in knowledge-generation and convening power
to support interventions by other partners. Factors that determined entry into new areas of
engagement or exit from current engagements included:

    •    A link to policy reform. Particular importance was given to ensuring a strong link to
         policies supporting the establishment of an enabling environment for private sector
         development, agriculture production, and marketing.

    •    Explicit government ownership. The Bank engaged only in areas where there was
         explicit request and concrete upfront signals and an agreement with the Government.

                                               72
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
    •   WBG’s comparative advantage. The Bank provided support only when it had a particular
        comparative advantage in technical skills, resources, convening power, or ability to
        mobilize international expertise.

Lending

24.     Volume, lending instruments, and scenarios: As of June 30, 2012, the Bank portfolio in
Malawi had 12 investment projects valued at US$861.1 million and two GEF-financed projects
and was managing two catalytic fund projects in the water and education sectors. Of this amount,
71 percent were credits and the rest grants. This support was distributed as follows: 30 percent
for human development; 37 percent for infrastructure development; 15 percent for agriculture,
rural development and natural resources; 15 percent for environment, and 3 percent for private
sector development. The Bank portfolio has two regional projects, in telecommunications and
trade insurance. Since 1966, the WBG has committed about US$2.6 billion to Malawi supporting
over 120 operations.

25.      CAS plans and actual deliveries: The CAS FY07-FY10 planned to deliver $340 million,
projected at $80 million a year for the first two years and $90 million for the last two years.
During this CAS FY07-FY12, IDA has committed about $890.0 million. The increased budget is
a result of successful replenishment of IDA 15, availability of crisis response window funds, and
extension of the implementation period by two years. Three of the planned four PRSCs were
delivered. Four additional financing operations were prepared, in the HIV/AIDS, agriculture,
water, and Social protection sectors. PRSCs were used to implement critical policy and
institutional reforms aimed at improving agriculture productivity, business the climate, dealing
with vulnerability to shocks and improving economic governance.

Portfolio Quality

26.     In FY06, 30 percent of the Bank’s Malawi projects were problematic, partly due to
insufficient capacity and lack of familiarity with Bank procurement procedures. Following the
Country Portfolio Performance Review in FY06, steps were taken to improve quality at entry
and portfolio performance, particularly through project-specific seminars to disseminate best
practices on procurement and financial management. Of the three problem projects, FIMTAP
was restructured and closed on September 1, 2009. Community Lands improved performance,
received US$10 million additional financing, and closed on September 30, 2011. ESSUP closed
successfully in December 2010. BESTAP was restructured in FY09 and was upgraded. Two
projects were cancelled: the Malaria Booster Program closed due to non-performance and the
Malawi–Mozambique Interconnector due to a change in priorities of the Malawi Government.
Two of the four additional financing projects that were processed in the period were needed to
cover cost-overruns, resulting from price increases, inadequate cost estimation, and delayed
                                               73
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
implementation. The FY10 CPPR indicated that portfolio performance was mixed. The
Infrastructure Services Project (ISP) was saved from cancellation by a remarkable turnaround
due to revamped collaboration between the Government and the Bank. Overall, the restructured
portfolio has improved tremendously in the last years of CAS implementation. At the time of this
report, there are no problem projects in the portfolio, partly due to Bank decentralization, which
increased skills availability at country level. Mini/quarterly CPPRs were used to track
implementation.

Analytical and Advisory Activities

27.      The Education Country Status Report (CSR), the Mining Sector Review (MSR), the
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), the 2008 Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP), and
the Malawi Social Protection Stock Take have significantly contributed to the planning and
policy environment. The CSR brought into focus issues affecting the quality of education in
Malawi at various levels. The findings fed into the National Education Sector Plan (NESP),
which has assisted the Government to leverage resources from various donors and the Fast Track
Initiative (FTI). The MSR in 2009 brought worldwide experience in the management of mining
transactions and informed the design of the Mining Policy. The MSR provided the analytical
underpinnings of a new Mining Governance and Growth Support Project. The CEM is a rich
piece that acknowledges the progress that Malawi has made in improving its macroeconomic
environment and proposes options on ensuring continued future growth. The 2008 FSAP was
instrumental in bringing financial sector development into the policy debate in Malawi and its

                                                          74
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
recommendations have greatly assisted in leading to other AAA, such as the Malawi Financial
Sector Development Strategy and Finscope Demand and Supply Side Surveys. A Financial
Sector TA operation has also been developed to implement the recommendations of the FSAP.
The Social Protection Stock Take informed the design of the social protection policy and has
helped Malawi move toward development of the Social Support Policy and Program.

28.     A few of the planned analytical work and advisory services were merged with other
AAAs or cancelled or put on hold. The planned AAA on the Weak Evidence Base on High
Value Crops was delivered as part of the agricultural background analysis which contributed to
the CEM to avoid duplication and provide a comprehensive picture for understanding the cost
structure and competitiveness of a number of key agricultural commodities as a basis for
assessing sources of agricultural growth in Malawi. The Forging Partnership with Agribusiness
AAA was put on hold because it was meant to be part of diagnostic studies to inform the design
of the Agriculture Commercialization project, which has been deferred to FY15. In a number of
cases, the diagnosis and recommendations of the Bank’s work were endorsed by the client, for
example, the recommendations of the CEM and the Mining Sector Review resulted in
Government demand for projects in mining, energy, and agriculture.

B. CAS Implementation

29.     CAS implementation monitoring arrangements: Internally, the Malawi CAS was
launched during a Country Team retreat held in March 2007. The retreat's objective was to
understand and develop a work plan for CAS implementation, based on the CAS Results Matrix.
Four CAS pillar teams discussed and presented critical steps necessary for the achievement of
the objectives. This translated into matrices that were used to track progress on a quarterly basis.
Specific country team and portfolio review meetings were organized in which CAS progress was
discussed. In keeping with the spirit of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the
Government of Malawi initiated annual Joint Programme Reviews (JPRs) with the Department
for International Development (DFID), European Union (EU), World Bank, German Technical
Cooperation (GTZ), and Norway. More donors joined later. The process was later converted into
MGDS annual review and eventually was augmented by regular CPPRs and mini CPPR
meetings with Government counterparts.

VI. COUNTRY DIALOGUE AND PARTNERSHIPS

30.      The Government has taken significant steps to strengthen donor coordination. Through
the Department of Debt and Aid in the Ministry of Finance, the Government is now taking a lead
role in the coordination of donor assistance. Its Development Assistance Strategy was published
in November 2007 and an Aid Calendar, outlining the expected timeline for disbursement of
donor funding, is now produced annually. A system of Sector Working Groups is being
institutionalized. The First High Level Forum meeting between the Government and the
Development Partners will be held on February 9, 2011. Further, nearly all development
assistance provided to the public sector is now included in the budget.




                                                75
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS

31.    At best program progress toward achieving the goals of FY07 CAS has been mixed.
Good progress has been made toward two of the four CAS pillars (HIV/AIDS and public
expenditure management). Mixed progress has been registered toward CAS Pillar 2, with some
encouraging developments on road infrastructure but little improvement in the investment
climate and much less in energy. Developments in the agriculture sector have also been mixed
(CAS Pillar 1).

32.     At completion, the objectives of the CAS remained relevant and aligned to the goals of
the MGDS. The priority areas outlined in the CAS remained the appropriate focus of Bank
resources and will remain so in the next CAS. A year of implementation was lost due to the then
prevailing political environment. This necessitated rescheduling of planned projects and
extension of the CAS implementation period. For example, political and administrative
constraints resulted in delayed implementation or preparation of certain projects (agriculture and
energy), and the availability of additional regional financing resulted in the inclusion of projects
consistent with regional policy (e.g., Regional Communications Infrastructure Project). The
available CRW funds have been successfully absorbed.

Experiences and Lessons

33.       Some highlights of lessons from the implementation of the FY07-FY12 CAS include:

      •   Alignment of the CAS with the MGDS enhanced ownership and commitment, and resulted
          in effective Bank contribution to the country’s development goals. The next CAS should
          likewise be aligned with the government program and it is worthwhile to postpone
          production of the new CAS to allow full alignment with MGDS II.

      •   Weak government capacity, especially in areas of financial management, procurement
          and project management as well as monitoring and evaluation, slowed down project
          implementation. The new CAS should help build the capacity of the Government in
          general. In addition, project designs should reflect capacity constraints on the ground.

      •   Covenant implementation affected project implementation. The new CAS should find
          alternative ways of supporting key reforms, for example, to link sector policy reform to
          budget support operations or ensure that essential policy reforms are implemented prior
          to proceeding with investment lending.

      •   Important role for civil society: Civil society, the private sector, and the media are able to
          offer strong contributions and an alternative voice, which is especially important if the
          political arena is dominated by one party. It is therefore recommended that the next CAS
          should scale up the involvement of civil society in Bank-supported projects and the role
          of the Bank in fostering a useful and productive dialogue between the Government and
          civil society.


                                                   76
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16
   •   Joint analytical pieces with other development partners help in building consensus,
       expanding ownership, and harmonizing support.

   •   Programmatic versus discrete projects: The portfolio is tilting toward programmatic
       approaches to financing, which helps leverage resources from other development partners
       as well as increasing impact on use of (sector) budget funds.

   •   There is a need for comprehensive fiduciary support, especially in sector-wide
       operations. Experiences in the Health and HIV pool, as well as from detailed
       procurement reviews, as was done in the fertilizer procurement, indicate that there is still
       significant need for comprehensive fiduciary support in sector-wide operations due to
       weak capacities in the Government. These lessons have already informed arrangements
       for the education pool and the design of the agriculture pool.

   •   Projects can influence policy: The implementation of MASAF contributed to a policy
       shift in Government and other stakeholders, for example the use of starter packs to
       conditional cash transfers in addressing food security and vulnerability.

                                     and income from cash crops. However, the

                                     from policy reversals, hence was not fully
                                     implemented.

   Improve irrigation and           Achieved. To date 90,000 ha are under irrigation nationwide, up from 73,480 in 2007.
    farming practices                These country-wide figures are uncertain and highly fluctuating due to the nature of the
-   Irrigated area increases by      informal sector. When the CAS was designed the figure of 28,000 ha of formal and semi-
    10% (2,500 ha) through           formal irrigation was used as the benchmark, with the drafters being aware of but not
    sustainable water                counting the fluctuating numbers of additional hectares in the informal sector. Against the
    management in 50 Water           target of 2,500 hectares additional irrigation, irrigated area increased to date by 3438 ha
    User Associations by 2009        with Bank support (37% over target), through rehabilitation of medium-scale schemes
                                     covering an area of 1,385 ha, and development of small-scale (10-50 ha) and mini-scale
-   Increased adoption by            (<10 ha) schemes covering a total area of 2,053 ha, benefiting over 20,000 farm
    farmers of best soil fertility   households. At scheme level, the project engaged the services of an NGO to facilitate the
    and crop technologies;           establishment and training of 40 Water User Associations (of the planned 50). The lower
    increase smallholders using      number of WUAs is not an underachievement; it is also a result of consolidation of the

    in 11 districts by 2009           will soon be fully achieved since all rehabilitation has been completed. Delayed
                                      completion of this task was caused by delayed rehabilitation schemes. These WUAs are
                                      gradually taking over management of the schemes.

                                      On-farm trials, demonstrations, and farmer try-outs have been implemented and have so
                                      far reached more than 300,000 farming households (20 percent of the 1.5 million
                                      households benefitting from FISP). Research and extension activities cover the following
                                      areas: improved seed development and use, with 14 varieties tested last year; crop nutrient

                                      outs; demonstrations on sustainable land and water management techniques reaching
                                      more than 30,000 farmers with close to 18,000 ha estimated to be under conservation
                                      agriculture; and demonstrations of post-harvest technologies with a focus on silos and

   Improve market incentives         Partially Achieved. The Bank supported restructuring of the state marketing board,
    for surplus production            ADMARC, and implemented a series of risk management initiatives. In line with the
-   ADMARC commercial and             restructuring program approved by the Cabinet in 2006, ADMARC streamlined its
    social functions separated by     activities by closing ancillary departments (clinics, tailoring workshops, etc.) and
    the end of 2007                   contracting out these services to the private sector. ADMARC has sold its shares in
                                      various subsidiary companies, closed down the ADMARC Investment Holding Company
                                      (AIHC), and laid off more than 400 staff. While concrete steps were taken to roll out
                                      reforms in ADMARC, including the establishment of MAWTCO and the transfer of six
                                      ADMARC warehouses to MAWTCO, the 2008 global food and fertilizer price crisis
                                      affected the Government’s resolve to proceed with these liberalization plans.
                                      MAWTCO’s establishment aimed at enhancing private sector participation in maize
                                      markets. Unfortunately, there have been delays in operationalizing MAWTCO. The
                                      smaller ADMARC has been mandated to operate as a commercial company. However, the
                                      Government continues periodically to demand that ADMARC purchase and sell maize at
                                      mandated prices, purchase cotton at mandated prices, and provide inputs under the Farm
                                      Input Subsidy Programme. This has resulted at times in a significant contingent liability
                                      and undermined the idea to run ADMARC as a solely commercial company.

-   Increased awareness of            Achieved. A national export strategy has been prepared and discussed with public and
    value of crop diversification     private stakeholders. The Ministry of Agriculture is developing action plans to promote
    to reduce income variation        new crops and to expand the contract farming approach with private investors. The Bank-
    by 2009                           funded IRLADP and ASWAp-SP have been promoting production of legumes
                                      (groundnuts, soya beans, and pigeon peas).

   Strengthen integration and        Partially Achieved. The CAS indicator on reducing travel time by 10% between farms
    links to input/output markets     within a 20km radius of the market center in areas supported by the Infrastructure
-   Travel time reduced by 10%        Services Project (ISP) was not featured in the ISP results framework; therefore, it has not
    between farms within a            been monitored. Unfortunately the Road Administration does not have any data relating to
    20km radius of the market         this indicator. However, this indicator was related to feeder road improvements that were
    center in areas supported by      done rather than surfacing of critical sections of the corridor roads. The Tsangano work
    the IIS by 2010                   has not been particularly long-lasting but has significantly contributed to reduced travel
                                      time. In this regard it could still be possible that travel time has been reduced by 10%, but
                                      no data are available to demonstrate this.
-   Private sector leads fertilizer
    procurement and                   The private sector is now contributing to the bulk procurement of the FISP fertilizer
    distribution, in partnership      requirement, with 65% procured by private suppliers in 2011/12 and 80% for this coming
    with Government ,by 2009          2012/13 cropping season. However, distribution in rural areas remains fully managed by
                                      public institutions (ADMARC and SFFRFM). On the seeds side, there is more progress:
                                      private sector outlets procure and distribute 100% of the seed package under the FISP.

    mitigation measures for food   ways that market-based tools and risk management strategies can replace traditional, ex
    security risks over time       post reactions to food shortages caused by drought. Three innovative pilot projects to
                                   improve its risk management related to food crops dealt with weather risk and maize price
                                   risk: (i) buying insurance against drought, (ii) using SAFEX financial derivatives to
                                   manage price risks associated with food crisis, and (iii) development of a warehouse
                                   receipt system. Support for on-going strengthening of the Government’s agricultural risk
                                   management capabilities is being provided by the Bank under the IDA-financed ASWAp-
                                   SP and the Disaster Risk Management Program, complementing work on building

    increased 25% by 2011 from
                                    approved by the Bank Board in 2007. However, the IDA credit offer was withdrawn in
    284 MW in 2006
                                    June 2010 after the Government of Malawi at the time indicated that it no longer
                                    considered it a priority project. The new Malawi government has re-launched discussion
                                    on this priority regional project with the Government of Mozambique, and it is being
                                    included in the pipeline for the next CAS. In parallel, IDA financing was proposed for an
                                    extension of the Kapichira hydropower plant by an additional 64M, representing a 22%
                                    increase in installed system generation capacity. The Government decided to fund this
                                    project from its own budget and construction is underway. The Government subsequently
                                    requested that IDA fund a US$84 million energy project that was approved in June 2011.
                                    Activities include strengthening and expansion of the transmission and distribution
                                    systems, studies for new hydropower sites, and energy efficiency activities. The MCC
                                    Compact was delayed in preparation, was signed in 2011, but was subsequently put on
                                    hold due to governance challenges until June 2012. This US$350 million program, which
                                    complements the scope of the Bank-financed energy project, is now beginning its

                                    Infrastructure reports that the proportion of classified paved roads in good or fair
                                    condition has increased from 84% in 2007 to 93% in 2010, although the condition of
                                    unpaved roads has deteriorated from 83% in good or fair condition in 2007 to 65% in
                                    2010. Government has recently approved an increase in road user charges and expects that
                                    Road Fund income will cover all maintenance costs within five years. Past poor contract
                                    management practices have resulted in substantial unbudgeted expenditure, but
                                    Government has now introduced improved controls. The Bank and European Commission
                                    have supported preparation of a multimodal transport study and the Government is
                                    preparing a Transport Sector Investment Program. The European Commission, African
                                    Development Bank, and Japanese International Cooperation Agency are making
                                    significant investments in the transport sector, primarily in roads. The Bank- financed
                                    Infrastructure Services Project, whose benefits have been delayed by slow
                                    implementation, is now starting to contribute to provision of integrated infrastructure
                                    (electricity, water, sanitation services, roads, and ICT) at five market centers that are
                                    considered growth corridors. To date, electricity supply has been extended to these
                                    centers, with the remaining components approaching completion. The current rail network
                                    concession is not producing the desired quality of service. The proposal to transport coal

                                    coming to fruition, and has attracted nearly US$1 billion in private investment. A
                                    concession agreement has been signed to construct a new link to the border with Tete
                                    province, and the EU and the Bank with PPIAF funding are advising Government on

                                   evident that the country has made significant efforts to improve the quality and standard
                                   of its procurement system, but a lot is yet to be accomplished. Progress has been largely
                                   hampered by inadequate human capacity and financial resources, data availability
                                   problems, noncompliance with procurement rules and procedures as well as insufficient
                                   procurement information. The PPA is generally recognized to be in line with international
                                   standards, though it does not adequately address some issues, such as decentralized
                                   procurement arrangements and asset management and disposal; currently, the Act is being
                                   further revised.

    Government Finance             Achieved: The FY 2009 GoM budget is Government Finance Statistics (GFS) compliant.
    Statistics (GFS) compliant     The new budget structure now comprises 19 standardized programs and sub-programs in
    and System of National         line with the 2001 GFS classifications, from 52 program classifications in previous
    Accounts (SNA) compliant       budgets. The new COA was fully implemented in the FY12 national budget. The 2011

    at 1st order level               PEFA assessment showed improved scores in the areas of classification of the budget and
                                     comprehensiveness of information included in the budget documentation, from a rating of
                                     B in 2008 to a rating of A in the 2011 PEFA.

   Intergovernmental fiscal and     Partially Achieved. While all ministries have internal audit units and internal audit
    expenditure management           committees (IACs), only 16 of the largest MDAs out of 22 had functional IACs that
-   Intergovernmental fiscal         actively met in 2008. This ensured coverage of about 75% of public expenditures. As of
    architecture fully operational   December 2010, only one IAC out of the six key spending ministries was reported to have
    at budget level by FY2009        an active Internal Audit. Non-functioning IACs continues to hamper effective follow-up
    budget                           of audit reports and implementation of audit recommendations. Efforts are now being
                                     geared toward injecting a new lease on life into the IAC with the recent approval of the
                                     Internal Audit Charter, which clearly specifies the Terms of Reference for the IACs and
                                     their roles and responsibilities. As the result, the IACs in the six key spending ministries
                                     started meeting regularly as of June 2011.
-   Sectoral Public Expenditure
    Tracking Surveys (PETS)          Partially achieved: The Government has catalogued recommendations presented in the
    used to inform expenditure       2008 PETS and 2006 PERS reports. The document was then circulated to all concerned
    allocations and address          sectors with a letter requesting them to provide updates on what has been done to
    weaknesses in flows of           implement the recommendations and address the issues that were raised in the reports in
    funds to local level by 2011     April 2011.

-   Parallel systems (MASAF)
    subsumed to local level by       Achieved: Previously MASAF used to have regional offices and sub-regional offices that
    2010                             were seen as parallel systems to local council operations. These were abolished and
                                     therefore the MASAF 3 APL II Project, which became effective in 2009 only, has the
                                     Technical Support Team at the national level. The entire project funding to the local
                                     councils passes through the National Local Government Finance Committee, as is the
                                     case with the transfers from the central government. All implementation is handled by the
                                     councils.

                                         Annex 3: Poverty Context

Poverty in Malawi remains widespread and concentrated in rural areas According to the recent
report of the Third Integrated Household Survey (IHS3 2010/11); the absolute poverty rate has
declined only slightly, from 52.4 percent (IHS2 2004/05) to 50.7 percent. While the poverty levels
for urban areas declined from 25.4 percent in 2005 to 17.3 percent in 2011, they worsened slightly in
rural areas, from 55.9 percent to 56.6 percent, during the same period. 20 Acute poverty affected 25
percent of the national population (compared with 22 percent in 2004/05), 4 percent of the urban
population, and 28 percent of the rural population. National consumption inequality, measured
through the Gini coefficient, has risen sharply from 0.39 to 0.45, mostly driven by the dynamics
in rural areas, where the Gini coefficient rose from 0.34 to 0.38 while staying roughly constant in
urban areas at about 0.49. A rise in rural inequality could explain how average incomes rose in
Malawi while living standards for the rural poor stagnated. Malawi’s inequality is still below that
of neighboring Zambia (one of the highest Ginis in SSA at 0.50), but higher than Tanzania
(0.34). Thus, while the increase in inequality is troubling and needs further investigation, if
Malawi is able to contain the increase in the next decade, the forecast for poverty reduction is
brighter.

According to the IHS 3, the proportions of poor and acutely poor people were found to be
highest in rural areas in the south (63% poor and 34% acutely poor) and in the north (59% poor
and 29% acutely poor). Poverty has been driven by limited access to education and production
assets, shocks affecting agricultural productivity, and lack of diversification and access to
markets. Poverty is also exacerbated by a high population growth rate (about 3 percent), high
population density, and HIV/AIDS prevalence. Nationally, the heads of the poorest households
have less schooling, are older, and are more likely to be female than the heads of better-off

20
  The difference between the IHS2 and the IHS3 national absolute poverty rates is not statistically significant. The
IHS3 rural poverty rate is also statistically indistinguishable from its IHS2 counterpart.

households. The poverty gap and the severity of poverty measures confirm that the worst poverty
is concentrated in rural areas in the most densely populated south and north, while the central
region is better off. Urban areas have much lower percentages of people below the poverty line
(17 percent), and they also have the lowest share of the acutely poor (4 percent). Therefore, any
strategy to reduce poverty in Malawi and make growth more inclusive must include a leading
role for rural growth and development, with a substantial focus on smallholder agriculture,
tourism development, infrastructure, and other non-farm employment creation.

Preliminary Analysis

Growth incidence analysis shows that real incomes of the rural poor are falling and only the
better-off households experience some growth in real expenditures. In order to understand what
is behind this trend, there is a need to analyze the crop portfolio, market participation, overall
household activity, and portfolio and income structure changes over time. This result also raises
concerns about the impact on poor rural households of the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP)
introduced in 2005/06 on poor rural households and specifically the beneficiary targeting
methodology. What is clear is that despite large state outlays to input subsidy programs, rural
poverty has not declined. Distribution of fertilizer and seed under the FISP is intended to benefit
poor households selected by communities with support from district councils and agricultural
district officials, as well as traditional authorities. While improvements in FISP targeting are
noted in the past two planting seasons and there was increased transparency (open meetings and
clearer selection criteria), evidence still points to significant redistribution, sharing, and reselling
of fertilizer and seeds.

The other dimension of poverty in rural areas that may explain this result is the structural
deficiencies of the local farming system, characterized by the small size of land holdings (less
than 1 hectare for almost 60% of the farms), no equipment, and limited or no livestock (imposing
a limitation on both sources of income and soil fertility management). In that context, emphasis
on FISP benefits may not be expected realistically to make a sustainable difference, and fertilizer
might be of better use for many poor households if re-sold (in addition to social pressure to
share).

Preliminary comparative analysis (IHS2 and IHS3) indicates that there has been some
specialization in crop production toward maize at the expense of other crops. In such a situation,
if returns of that specialization less than compensate for the loss of crops households choose not
to grow, overall incomes will fall. Preliminary evidence also shows that proceeds from maize are
also stagnating in terms of value, and sales continue to be very concentrated in relatively better-
off households. This would be consistent with the low levels of consumption expenditure among
the poor. The initial results seem to suggest that as a result of the expanded FISP, households
tended to specialize in maize and in doing so reduced other streams of income so that the net
gains of that dynamic are negative.

The IHS3 is a very rich data set and will provide the basis for thorough analysis of the
determinants of household well-being in all areas and all groups in Malawi. The value of the HIS
data will be elevated with the planned Integrated Household Panel Survey (IHPS) 2013, which
will track and re-interview about 25 percent of the IHS3 sample. The two datasets will be
instrumental in depicting movements in and out of poverty, and the correlates of chronic vs.
transient poverty status in Malawi, Other questions that could be tackled with the data include:
What were the sources of growth in consumption at the household level, and what were the
sources of the growth in inequality? Analysis should help identify the winners and the losers, and
more importantly the factors underlying these processes. Did Government policies help some but
not others? Did the increase in food and other commodity prices hurt some while others
benefited? Did some farmers suffer more from shocks than others? What characterizes those
households in the groups that appear to have gained from growth?

Planned Poverty Analysis Work and Technical Assistance

In the coming months, the Bank, through a series of policy notes, will analyze these data in
search of answers to these questions and others, starting with analysis of the behavior,
livelihoods, and welfare of rural households, as well as establish the link between farming
household assets, farm size, and poverty level. The rural and agricultural population should not
be treated as one homogenous group; a farm typology based on IHS3 data may show that the
situation of less poor agricultural households has improved while the situation of the poorest
farmers has deteriorated, leading to a slight increase of the aggregate poverty level in rural areas.
In addition, the introduction of a stricter yield measurement methodology combining traditional
field surveys and remote sensing tools (satellite imagery) could better assess real productivity
gains of FISP beneficiaries. These analyses may result in questioning the impact of the FISP and
have major implications for FISP design and its underlying objective in terms of deciding
whether it is meant to be a social safety net program or a program to increase agricultural
productivity. The Bank will also make use of available research on Malawi and will explore
opportunities to collaborate with researchers from DECRG (as outlined in Box 3 in the text) and
from academia in areas of interest.

On technical assistance, the Bank Living Standards Measurement Study Team within DECPI has
been collaborating with the National Statistical Office (NSO) on a multi-year program with the
objective of designing and implementing the IHS3 in 2010/11 and IHPS in 2013. As part of this
work program, the NSO has been and will continue to be supported by a strong LSMS field
presence through a resident advisor, and frequent missions from Bank headquarters. Bank
support to the IHS3 and the IHPS is within the cross-country nationally-representative panel
household survey program in sub-Saharan Africa known as the LSMS-Integrated Surveys on
Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) initiative. The IHS3 was also supported by Norway, DFID, Irish Aid,
and MCC, and it is likely that multiple donors will contribute to the implementation of the IHPS
as well. The World Bank also provided technical assistance to the NSO on finalization of the
analysis of the results from the IHS3, including the CPI Technical Assistance to support the
exercise of coming up with new poverty numbers. As part of the Bank’s Open Data Access
initiative and the LSMS-ISA mandate, the IHS3 data was made publicly available on the LSMS
website within 12 months of field work completion. Under the new CAS, the Bank plans to

                                Gender Results Monitoring Framework

Strengthen Mainstreaming of Gender throughout the Portfolio
During the CAS period the county team will further increase the integration of gender issues into
proposed and on-going activities as appropriate. In preparation for the CAS, a gender assessment
and a portfolio review were carried out in close consultation with the Country Team. Gender
issues in the country identified by the assessment are reflected in the CAS report and priority
gender-responsive actions have been identified to respond to these issues based on review of the
current and pipeline portfolios. The Bank’s gender program during the CAS period will focus on
the following three national gender equality areas:
     •       equal access to education,

     •       equal access to financial markets and land, and

     •       income opportunities for rural women.

Interventions in these areas are supported by analytical work. The following sub-sectors
contribute to the key response areas: education, water, financial, environment, agriculture, and
social.

Moreover, under the FY13 - 16 CAS, the goal will be to further expand an empirically-based
gender-informed approach to reducing poverty in Malawi, utilizing a portfolio of operations and
analytical work where gender is explicitly and appropriately incorporated and features
prominently in supervision and implementation support. Key measures to monitor progress
toward this goal are assessment of whether a project has “a gender-responsive design? and
“gender in the Project Results Framework.? Table A6.1 supports the goal of a more gender-
informed portfolio 21.




21
   The following principles have been used to establish baseline data: For a project to be rated “yes? as having a
“gender responsive design,? the PAD would demonstrate that (a) there has been a gender analysis as part of the
social assessment during project preparation or relevant diagnosis and recommendations from a Country Gender
Assessment (by the Bank or partners) has been adopted; and (b) the results of that analysis have informed project
design, as indicated by at least one of the following: (i) specific project policy or activity that seeks to promote
gender equality through either gender targeted or universal policy/project intervention; or (ii) at least one gender-
specific target or indicator in the Results Framework. The Project Results Framework will be used as reference
because it is the binding agreement between the Bank and the government and thus would be the basis for
accountability and performance rating.

                           Annex 7: CAS Stakeholder Consultations

1.      Between December 2010 and July 2012, the WBG held consultations with government
officials, civil society, the private sector, academia, media, and development partners to draw up
a new strategy to support Malawi’s Second Growth and Development Strategy (MDGS II, 2011-
2016). The consultations, which were face-to-face, were held in all three geographic regions of
the country, in Blantyre, Lilongwe, and Mzuzu, which are the hub cities for stakeholders. More
than 150 institutions were represented in these consultations.

2.     Two sets of consultations were held during the administrations of two different Malawi
presidents. The first set ran from December 2010 to April 2012, when the late President
Mutharika was in power, during which substantive work was done on the CAS. The Government
program that informed the CAS was the draft MDGS II. After his death in April 2012, President
Banda and her Cabinet quickly approved the MDGS II in April but in early July the president
held a national symposium to further rationalize priorities to revive the economy. The
symposium identified five areas: agriculture, energy, mining, tourism, and infrastructure. This
necessitated a second round of consultations with Government to validate the draft CAS in view
of the change in political leadership and identification of new priorities. A second round of
consultations was also held with development partners through the Heads of Cooperation.

3.     The first round of consultations was guided by a Concept Note that identified three
themes: (i) Promoting sustainable, diversified, and inclusive growth; (ii) enhancing human
capital and reducing vulnerabilities; and (iii) mainstreaming governance for enhanced
development effectiveness. The consultations sought stakeholder views of these themes and
obtained feedback about specifics to be covered under each theme.

4.      Stakeholders generally endorsed the three thematic areas. With regard to Theme 1, they
recommended that the CAS (i) promote commercialization, agro-processing, and value addition
as a basis for growth of the agricultural sector; (ii) trade promotion and empowerment of micro-,
small, and medium enterprises; (iii) development of energy supply (one stakeholder said, “Power
shortages severely constrain private sector growth and access to ICT services, thereby inhibiting
poverty reduction efforts. Access to power should therefore be one of the key priorities for
Malawi as well as for the World Bank?) and (iv) infrastructure, with suggestions to have it stand
alone as a pillar and “not hidden in the other pillars, since so many other developments are
dependent on infrastructure.?

5.      For Theme 2, stakeholders gave priority to issues of jobs, health, climate and
environmental degradation: (i) development of entrepreneurial skills to enable educated people
to become employers (there was concern that the CAS was silent on unemployment issues); (ii)
primary school health should be an important element; (iii) nutrition is a weak sector requiring
both funds and institutional strengthening; (iv) the WBG’s silence on health is not good for
Malawi; (v) climate change should be a priority area because it will affect agriculture and energy
if not considered critically; and (vi) environmental degradation especially in relation to the Shire.

6.     For Theme 3, stakeholders observed that governance should not be about systems and
capacity only, but there should also be an emphasis on checks and balances. They also asked that

the WBG be more specific about how it is going to engage with civil society and the media and
make corruption a salient governance issue.

7.    While commending the WBG’s selectivity, stakeholders also bemoaned the size of the
IDA envelope for Malawi. Suggestions were made to have a larger envelope for fewer sectors to
have more impact than is currently the case.

8.      Government and development partners had their own issues in addition to some of those
raised above. The government view was that the CAS Concept Note was generally well aligned
with the MGDS II. “The first theme is particularly in the same direction as the MGDS II. So too
are the issues on diversification, productivity, public management, and skills,? said the Principal
Secretary for Development Planning. On the scheduling of proposed operations and analytical
work, the government urged for timing that enables a better tie-in between its program and
proposed WBG-supported operations. The government welcomed the idea of reduced covenants
because covenants delay implementation. While agreeing with the proposed analytical work
program, government representatives requested more AAA on issues of land and urban
development. Government stakeholders also keenly followed the presentations on the new Africa
Strategy. Observing that Malawi is reflected in the AFR strategy, they wondered why the CAS
CN does not articulate gender and CSO issues as clearly as the AFR strategy does.

9.      Development partners raised questions about collaboration, systems, and some project-
specific matters. They observed that the WBG’s collaboration with other partners in such sectors
as education is quite strong but the CAS does not truly reflect coordination issues. They also
called for more collaboration where there are high degrees of synergy and overlap with other
donors. They wanted to know if the proposed program has a built-in efficiency system to ensure
value for money. On specific operations, they wanted to know if some projects, such as
BESTAP, would have follow-ups; involvement of other development partners in EITI; more
information on regional initiatives, such as regional rail; and how the WBG sees partnerships
evolving in new sectors, such as nutrition. Commenting on the AFR strategy, they were pleased
with the decentralization of knowledge hubs and the opportunity to access WBG expertise closer
to Malawi.

10.     In the second round of consultations with Government, it was agreed that the CAS was
generally in line with Government priorities, but there were specific requests about, e.g.,
prioritizing power generation, which is a serious problem for Malawi; the supply chain for
agricultural produce; supporting industry; transport infrastructure, especially for cross-border
trade; and doing more in higher education.

11.     The development partners in their second round also noted that Malawi’s problems had
not changed with the regime change, so the CAS was still in sync with Malawi’s needs. There
was commendation on the inclusion of vocational training and suggestions about stepping up
civil service capacity, including that of ministers; incorporating corruption to keep pressure on
governance; better coordination with the more numerous donors interested in commercial
agriculture; and recognizing urbanization as a risk, since Malawi is one of the fastest urbanizing
countries yet is not prepared for it. Some partners indicated interest in keeping in touch with the
Bank on regional integration issues.

                     Annex 8: Social Accountability in the Malawi Portfolio

Social accountability refers to the broad range of actions and mechanisms beyond voting that
citizens can use to hold the state to account, as well as actions on the part of government, civil
society, media, and other societal actors that promote or facilitate these efforts. Pillar 3 of this
new CAS covers social accountability. This table outlines social accountability tools that various
projects in the entire portfolio, continuing and new, could use to promote citizen participation in
engaging authorities in achieving results and staying accountable. Individual projects will
therefore be expected to make budgetary provision for social accountability activities.
