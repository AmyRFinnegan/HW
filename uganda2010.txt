                                    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i.     Political Developments. The National Resistance Movement, headed by Yoweri
Museveni, took power in 1986, bringing about a period of political and economic renewal.
Northern Uganda, however, suffered from two decades of war, until the Lord's Resistance
Army was pushed out of Uganda in 2005. Uganda has progressed towards multi-party
democracy. President Museveni is likely to seek a fourth term in March 2011.

ii.     Economic Developments. Uganda has a record of prudent macroeconomic
management and structural reform. Despite various exogenous shocks, annual GDP growth
averaged 7 percent in the 1990s, and accelerated to over 8 percent from 2001 to 2008. Due to
high population growth, real GDP growth per capita averaged only 3.4 percent over the
1990s, and just over 4 percent over the 2000s.

iii.    Poverty, Human Development, and Demography. The poverty rate fell from 57
percent in FY93 to 31 percent in FY06, although there is substantial and growing urban-rural
and regional inequality. Uganda may reach at least two of the eight Millennium Development
Goals by 2015--the country is close to halving poverty and addressing gender inequality, and
has made progress towards many others.

iv.     Economic Prospects. Due partly to the global economic crisis, growth slowed in
FY09 and is expected to remain below potential in FY10-11. Beyond the crisis, GDP growth
is expected to remain robust, averaging about 7 percent from FY12 to FY14. Oil production
will change Uganda's economic outlook, but full-scale production is unlikely to begin before
2016.

v.      Development Challenges. To sustain high growth and structurally transform the
economy, Uganda needs to address infrastructure bottlenecks, increase agricultural
productivity and value addition, reintegrate northern Uganda, manage urbanization, and
strengthen its human capital base. A rapidly growing population creates challenges for
employment and service delivery. An overarching challenge is to improve governance and
value for money, thereby enhancing service delivery and infrastructure investments, and to
build a clear and transparent institutional framework to ensure that future oil revenues benefit
the entire population.

vi.    Government Strategy. In February 2010, Uganda's Cabinet approved a National
Development Plan (NDP) covering FY11-15. The NDP's main theme is Growth,
Employment and Socio-Economic Transformation for Prosperity. The plan broadens the
country's development strategy from poverty reduction to structural transformation to raise
growth and living standards.

vii.    Implementation of the World Bank's Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS).
Executive Directors discussed the UJAS, the first joint multi-donor strategy of its kind, in
January 2006. The UJAS Completion Report rates Bank achievements under the UJAS as
moderately satisfactory. Lessons identified by the UJAS Completion Report and incorporated
into the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) are: (i) focus on fewer outcomes and ensure a
clear results framework; (ii) strengthen support to improve governance and help the
government identify and track governance indicators to guide governance interventions; (iii)
link Poverty Reduction Support Credit reforms to sector strategies supported by sector
operations; (iv) focus on developing on-the-ground mechanisms to improve aid coordination
and alignment with national priorities, rather than on joint strategic documents; and (v) at
project design stage, anticipate possible delays in credit effectiveness due to Uganda's
lengthy approval process.

viii.   CAS Objectives and Results. The World Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS), aligned with Uganda's NDP, will support structural transformation of the economy. It
provides a framework for World Bank Group support for five years (FY11-15). The CAS
focuses on four strategic objectives and eleven outcomes:
       Promote Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth. There are four
       outcomes: (i) improved conditions for private sector growth; (ii) improved
       interconnectivity for regional integration; (iii) increased productivity and
       commercialization of agriculture; and (iv) increased efficiency and sustainability of
       natural resource management.
       Enhance Public Infrastructure. There are four outcomes: (i) increased access to
       electricity; (ii) improved access to and quality of roads; (iii) increased access to and
       quality of water and sanitation services; and (iv) improved management and delivery
       of urban services.
       Strengthen Human Capital Development. There are two outcomes: (i) improved
       access to and quality of primary and post-primary education; and (ii) strengthened
       health care delivery.
       Cross-cutting: Improve Good Governance and Value for Money. There is one
       outcome: strengthened accountability and efficiency of public financial and human
       resource management.

ix.     Proposed CAS Program. IDA resources under the FY011-15 CAS are estimated at
about SDR1.3 billion (US$1.97 billion equivalent). Development policy operations are
expected to account for about one-third of annual IDA financing, as was the case during
UJAS implementation. The Bank will prepare a CAS Progress Report in FY13, or earlier if
required, to update and adjust the CAS program as needed.

x.      Partnership. Development partners (DPs) in Uganda continue to seek ways to
further improve aid effectiveness. Recognizing the limitations of collective documents such
as the UJAS, DPs are focusing on basket funds, sector-wide approaches, and new
coordination mechanisms, such as the Joint Budget Support Framework. The Bank chairs the
Local Development Partners' Group, the apex DP forum in Uganda.

xi.     Risks. Risks for CAS implementation include the upcoming presidential and
parliamentary elections; weak governance, especially in the context of future oil wealth; and
exogenous risks, such as weather, international prices, natural disasters, and insecurity in
neighboring countries. To mitigate risks, the CAS addresses inclusive growth and regional
integration; energy and transport (the binding constraints for growth); human development;
and governance and value for money.

                                   FOR THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA

                                             I. COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                    A. Political and Governance Context

1.      Uganda has the typical characteristics of a "bottom billion" country. It is landlocked and,
until recently, resource scarce, and neighboring countries are poor and many are prone to conflict.
Uganda is also ethnically diverse, which increases a country's risk of divisions and conflict.1

2.     Following independence in 1962, the country experienced relative political and
economic stability until a 1971 military coup by Idi Amin Dada. Violence and mismanagement
reduced the country to a failed state with a collapsed economy. Political and economic turmoil
continued from 1979 to 1985, with successive coups and a disputed election in 1980 that led to
armed rebellions across the country.

3.     The National Resistance Movement (NRM), led by Yoweri Museveni, took power in
1986, beginning a sustained period of economic and political renewal. During its first decade in
power, the NRM focused on reconstructing the economy and establishing legitimate government.
The government advanced pro-market reforms and political liberalization. Despite being landlocked
and resource scarce, Uganda became one of the fastest growing countries in Africa. Donor assistance
in support of reform grew to 52 percent of the annual budget in the early 1990s.

4.      Northern Uganda is now secure; but it missed out on two decades of growth and poverty
reduction. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) waged a brutal war that displaced 1.86 million people
and resulted in about 10,000 deaths. There have been no major security incidents since 2006;
economic activity is now resuming and most internally displaced people (about 1.3 million) have
returned to their villages. Pushed out of Uganda, the LRA now operates in the remote border area
between Southern Sudan, northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and the Central
African Republic. LRA leader Joseph Kony remains at large despite a 2005 International Criminal
Court warrant for his arrest on 33 charges, including crimes against humanity.

5.       There has been political stability and progress towards multi-party democracy. Uganda
has not yet, however, experienced a change of power through elections. Following the promulgation
of the 1995 constitution, non-party elections took place in 1996, providing President Museveni with
his first elected term after ten years in office. He was reelected in 2001. Constitutional amendments
approved by referendum in July 2005 introduced multi-partyism. At the same time the Uganda
Parliament voted to lift presidential term limits. Multi-party elections were held in 2006; and
President Museveni's NRM Party won the election with 59 percent of the vote. President Museveni
is expected to seek a fourth term in March 2011.

6.      There is a perception of increasing corruption at all levels. Despite a strong anti-
corruption legal framework, Uganda has struggled to translate its anti-corruption laws into practice.
There have been four high-level corruption cases during the last two years, none of which has been


1
  The 1995 Constitution of Uganda recognizes 56 indigenous peoples. However, according to the 2008 "State of
Uganda's Population Report," about 70 percent of the country's 29.6 million people are from the eight largest tribes:
Baganda (south) with 17.3 percent; Banyankole (west) with 9.8 percent; Basoga (east) with 8.6 percent; Bakiga
(west) with 7.0 percent; Iteso (east) with 6.4 pecent; Langi (north) with 6.1 percent; Acholi (north) with 4.7 percent;
and Bagisu (east) with 4.6 percent.
fully resolved so far. Local public opinion polls indicate that petty corruption is widespread and
increasing. In addition, Uganda suffers from pervasive "quiet corruption"--the failure of public
servants to deliver goods or services paid for by governments--such as unchecked teacher and health
worker absenteeism.2 The perception of deteriorating governance is tarnishing Uganda's image as a
development model.

7.       The recent discovery of oil brings both development opportunities and challenges.
Global experience demonstrates that natural resource wealth in the context of poverty and weak
institutions increases the probability of corruption, patronage, instability, and conflict. Whether
Uganda's oil is a blessing or curse depends largely on the establishment of an institutional framework
that ensures fair and equitable distribution of resource rents and appropriate consideration of
economic, social, and environmental issues.

                                 B. Economic Developments and Prospects

Economic Developments

8.      Over the past two decades, Uganda has established a strong record of prudent
macroeconomic management and structural reform. Uganda was one of the first Sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) countries to embark on liberalization and pro-market policies in the late 1980s. Uganda
was also one of the first SSA countries to adopt a policy of decentralization. Through the 1990s, the
government maintained a stable macroeconomic environment and continued to undertake private-
sector oriented reforms.

9.     By 2006, Uganda had graduated into a mature reformer.3 Annual gross domestic product
(GDP) growth rates averaged 7 percent in the 1990s and accelerated to more than 8 percent over the
seven years to 2007/08. However, due to rapid population growth, real GDP growth per capita
averaged only 3.4 percent in the 1990s and around 4 percent in the 2000s. (See Table 1; additional
economic data can be found in Annexes 2 and 3.)

10.     Macroeconomic stability and sound policies have helped sustain growth despite
exogenous shocks. Conflicts in neighboring DRC and Southern Sudan constrained regional trade.
Post-election unrest in Kenya in December 2007 resulted in temporary closure of the main trading
route to Mombasa, underscoring Uganda's vulnerability as a landlocked country. Uganda has also
endured droughts, a severe energy crisis, and surges in food and oil prices.

11.      Private investment and exports have been important drivers of growth; both almost
trebled in real terms between FY01 and FY08. Private investments were mainly driven by
construction of commercial and residential property. The rise in exports was led by fish, tourism, and
oil re-exports (and, to a lesser extent, flowers, tobacco, and maize), rather than the traditional exports
of coffee, tea, and cotton. Primary agricultural commodities still account for more than 50 percent of
exports, and exports of food staples to the DRC, Kenya, Rwanda, and Southern Sudan have increased
in recent years.


2
   A 2010 World Bank report titled "Silent and Lethal: How quiet corruption undermines Africa's development
efforts" contends that one of the main reasons behind Africa's lagging economic development is poor service
delivery resulting from quiet corruption. Quiet corruption is less visible than big-time corruption but occurs across a
much wider set of transactions directly affecting a large number of beneficiaries and very often has deep long-term
consequences on households, farms, and firms.

  In 2006, Uganda graduated to an International Monetary Fund non-lending Policy Support Instrument.

12.     The economy has undergone gradual structural transformation over the past two
decades, but at an increasingly slower pace.4 As share of total output, services increased from 32
percent in 1990 to 48 percent in 2000 and to 52 percent in 2008. Industry as a share of total output
increased from 11 percent in 1990 to 23 percent in 2000, but then remained almost unchanged at 26
percent in 2008. Over the same period, agriculture as a share of total output decreased sharply from
57 percent in 1990 to 30 percent in 2000 and to 23 percent in 2008.

13.     Consistent with structural transformation, production is becoming spatially
concentrated. The agricultural potential of northern Uganda has not been exploited due to twenty
years of conflict. Higher value agricultural production is geographically concentrated in the southern,
central, and western areas of the country. Modern sector economic activity is also geographically
clustered around large towns and along transport corridors.

14.    The labor market transition has lagged the structural change of the economy, as
expected. Many economically active people are trapped in low productivity, low income activities
due to both a poorly educated and rapidly growing (3 percent per annum) labor force. Agriculture
and non-wage smaller enterprises employ the bulk of new entrants into the labor market.

15.     In recent years, the government has shifted public expenditures towards addressing
Uganda's infrastructure constraints. The 2006 energy crisis, the deterioration of transport
infrastructure, and analytical work highlighting binding constraints to growth led to a scaling up of
infrastructure investments in the budget since FY 2008.

16.      Uganda's tax-to-GDP ratio is the lowest among East Africa Community (EAC)
countries. Government revenue excluding grants amounted to 12.5 percent of GDP in FY 2009,
compared to the EAC average, excluding Uganda, of 17.8 percent. Efforts to boost tax receipts have
relied largely on improvements in revenue administration. The forthcoming introduction of a national
identification system may also help reduce tax evasion.



4
 Structural transformation typically involves: a falling share of agriculture in GDP and employment, a rising share
of urban economic activity in industry and modern services, and migration of rural workers to urban settings.
                                                                     -3-
17.      Uganda's economy was better positioned than many in Africa to weather the global
economic crisis; but the impact of the crisis has become more apparent. Initially, Uganda's
economy showed resiliency due to strong fundamentals, prudent policies, comfortable reserves, and a
sound and well regulated financial system. Exports, remittances, and foreign direct investment began
to slow in late 2008, and the government responded with increased public investment expenditures as
a fiscal stimulus. In FY09, GDP growth fell to 7.1 percent, only slightly short of the projected 8.0
percent. However, the fiscal stimulus package was less effective than anticipated: public investment
expenditures fell substantially short of budget plans due to implementation constraints. 5 In FY10,
GDP growth is expected to fall to 5.6 percent.

18.     Uganda has taken further steps toward regional integration since signing the EAC
treaty in 1999. Uganda was a signatory to the EAC Customs Union launched in January 2005, which
aims to reduce non-tariff barriers and stimulate trade. An EAC Common Market protocol signed in
November 2009 will allow for the free movement of goods, people, and services, increasing
Uganda's opportunities for regional trade and investment. Uganda has demonstrated its commitment
to EAC integration by reducing tariffs, harmonizing standards, and supporting the establishment of
the East African Legal Assembly. Uganda is also a member of the Common Market for East and
Southern Africa (COMESA). The EAC, COMESA, and the Southern Africa Development
Community are working to increase collaboration and launch a new East and Southern African Free
Trade Area.

19.     Since 1990, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) has improved the timeliness and
quality of its data. Uganda has today one of the most professional and transparent statistical offices
in Africa. With the support of the Bank and other development partners, UBOS is addressing its
remaining weaknesses, which include agricultural statistics and data on businesses. UBOS recently
completed an agricultural census, and will soon update its data on firms. During the CAS, the Bank
will provide technical support to UBOS, including to field and analyze a new series of panel multi-
purpose household surveys and prepare a new national statistics development plan.

Poverty, Human Development, and Demography

20.     Uganda's high economic growth rates have enabled substantial poverty reduction. The
proportion of people living in poverty fell from 57 percent in FY93 to 31 percent in FY06. The
decline in poverty, particularly from 2002 to 2006, can be attributed to higher crop prices,
agricultural diversification, growth of non-wage non-farm employment (primarily household
enterprises), and the creation of new wage jobs in urban areas, particularly Kampala.

21.     However, there is substantial and growing urban-rural inequality and inequality
between regions. The national Gini coefficient rose from 0.35 percent in 1997 to 0.41 percent in
2006, in part because Uganda's growth path has created opportunities in urban areas of the center and
west, while wide swaths in rural areas and the north and east were left behind. In particular, northern
Uganda has the highest rate of income poverty at nearly 60 percent, and poverty reduction in north
and north-eastern regions has only been marginal. The poverty headcount rate could have declined by
a further six percentage points if inequality hadn't widened. The end of conflict in northern Uganda
provides opportunities for poverty reduction, although agricultural production has yet to reach levels
adequate to lift households out of poverty.


5
  The Eighth Poverty Reduction Support Credit (US$120 million, FY11) will help address implementation and
absorptive capacity constraints, which in turn should allow the fiscal stimulus to be more effective. The Bank's
analytical work, including the recent Roads PER, also provides advice to reduce implementation constraints.
                                                     -4-
22.    Uganda is expected to reach at least two of the eight Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) by 2015 (see Box 1). The country is close on halving poverty and has made substantial
progress towards universal primary education and in addressing gender inequality. Uganda may even
achieve the targets for combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other communicable diseases ensuring
environmental sustainability; and developing global partnerships. MDGs on reducing child mortality
and improving maternal health are unlikely to be met. Uganda ranks 156 of 179 in the FY09 Human
Development Index of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The government, with
UN support, is preparing its third MDG Progress Report, ahead of the September 2010 UN summit.

         Box 1: Uganda's Prospects for Achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015
Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
Likely. Uganda has made steady and impressive progress on poverty eradication. The number of households living
in poverty has declined from 56 percent in 1992 to 44 percent in 1997, 38 percent in FY02, and 31 percent in FY06.
Uganda is expected to exceed the target of 28 percent by 2015. The proportion of underweight children under five
years fell from 25.5 percent in 1995 to 20.4 percent in 2006, but is still far from the target of 11.5 percent.
Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education
Possible. The introduction of UPE in 1997 led to a 132 percent increase in gross enrollment from 3 million children
in 1996 to 7.5 million in 2006. In FY08, Uganda recorded a net enrollment ratio of 93 percent (91 percent for girls,
95 percent for boys). However, completion rates are low at 52 percent (FY09). Drop out and repetition rates need to
be addressed or recent achievements will be reversed.
Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women
Likely. The ratio of girls to boys in primary (0.99), secondary (0.85) and tertiary (0.72) education institutions
indicate progress in achieving gender equality in education, as does the ratio of literate women to men age 15-24
(0.84). In the current parliament, 89 of the 310 members are women, representing 29 percent of the legislative body,
up from 18 percent in 1995.
Goal 4: Reduce child mortality
Highly unlikely. The infant mortality rate improved from 119 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1989 to 76 deaths in
2006 (compared to the MDG target of 31). The under-five mortality rate fell from 180 to 137 deaths per 1,000 live
births during the same period (compared to the MDG target of 56).
Goal 5: Improve maternal health
Highly unlikely. The maternal mortality rate stagnated at over 500 deaths per 100,000 live births between 1989 and
2000. The estimated maternal mortality is 435 deaths per 100,000 live births (2006) against the MDG target of 131.
On average, only 41 percent of all deliveries receive skilled attendance.
Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
Possible. By reducing prevalence rates from around 20 percent in 1990 to 7 percent in 2008, Uganda has already
achieved the MDG target for combating HIV/AIDS. Malaria remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
Uganda. As of 2003, there were 478 reported cases of malaria per 1,000 people. The MDG target for malaria could
be achieved if the anti-malarial interventions continue to expand as planned.
Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability
Possible. Uganda has made progress in increasing access to safe drinking water. Access to clean water has improved
to 65 percent against a target of 62 percent, but access to improved sanitation is only 68 percent against a target of
72 percent. There is persistent degradation of the country's natural resources, including declining soil fertility;
deforestation; decreasing fish stocks; and water pollution caused by discharge from industries and domestic waste.
The forest cover in Uganda declined from 26 percent in 1990 to 18 percent by 2007. The proportion of titled land
remains 13 percent, versus an MDG target of 25 percent.
Note: Data based on most recent local sources, and therefore not fully consistent with data in Annex 2.



                                                              -5-
23.      The government has sought to expand access to social services, especially education.
Since the introduction of universal primary education (UPE) in 1997, net enrollment has increased to
about 92 percent for boys and girls, although completion rates remain low at 52 percent. In 2006,
Uganda launched a phased universal post-primary education and training program to absorb an
increasing number of primary education graduates and improve the low secondary enrollment rates
(27 percent in 2008). However, the Ministry of Education's annual sector reviews and a draft
parliamentary report reviewing the government's free education programs warn that increases in
enrollment are stressing existing school systems and facilities, negatively affecting educational
quality.

24.     Improvements in health care have been mixed. Malnutrition and maternal, child, and
infant mortality have improved, but remain unacceptably high: nearly one in seven children die
before age five; and one in five children under five years is underweight, down from one in four in
1995. Maternal mortality is among the highest in the world, linked to high fertility and poor pre- and
post-natal care. There are high human capital losses due to morbidity and mortality from largely
preventable and curable diseases and infections, such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis.

25.      Governance and capacity weaknesses hinder service delivery. Public expenditure reviews
(PERs) in education (FY08) and health (FY09) have revealed high inefficiencies and wastage of
public finances, particularly through high teacher and health care worker absenteeism rates and weak
drug procurement and supply management. Low actual spending of budget allocations suggests
challenges in complying with public financial management regulations, and there are frequent reports
of misuse of public funds. Basic social services are delivered by local governments; thus, weaknesses
in decentralization affect service delivery (see Box 2). There is a high administration burden at the
district level, with wages consuming a large and increasing share of total expenditures, leaving
insufficient funding for non-wage needs. The continued creation of new districts in Uganda is
expected to exacerbate this situation.

26.      Uganda's population dynamics pose a challenge to development. It has the third highest
total fertility rate in the world (6.7 births per woman according to government data). Population has
doubled since 1988; and the median age is just above 15 years. Uganda is one of the few countries
where the number of young-age dependents exceeds (by 10 percent) the number of working age
individuals. This dependency rate makes it difficult to achieve sufficient per child investments in
health and education, and also lowers the country's savings rate. It will be a challenge for the
government to keep pace with the increasing demand for social services, let alone improve their
quality. The lower savings rate is likely to translate into a lower investment rate.

Medium-Term Prospects

27.      Partly as a result of the global economic crisis, real GDP growth is expected to increase only
slightly to about 6.4 percent in FY11. IDA Crisis Response Window resources (US$70 million) will
help the government maintain essential social expenditures, including for reproductive health.

28.     Uganda's medium-term growth prospects remain solid. Services will continue to be the
main driver of growth, underpinned by sustained growth in communications and by growth in the
transport sector as infrastructure improves and regional trade expands. Uganda has a comparative
advantage in agriculture, which, if exploited, can contribute significantly to growth. Agricultural
production in the north is expected to increase and regional demand for Uganda's exports,
particularly food, is likely to grow. As firms take advantage of the EAC, overall manufacturing,
particularly agro-based manufacturing, is expected to increase. Overall GDP growth is expected to
remain robust, averaging about 7 percent from FY12-14.
                                                -6-
                                      Box 2: Decentralization in Uganda
Uganda was one of the first countries in Africa to embark on decentralization. Local governments are
responsible for providing basic public services, such as primary education, primary health care, water and sanitation,
feeder roads, and agriculture extension services; and line ministries are responsible for policies, standards,
supervision, and oversight and training of local governments. There are three levels of local government: districts
and cities; municipalities and city divisions; and towns and sub-counties.
Policy reversals over the last five years are hindering service delivery and value for money:
   Near-elimination of local revenue base. Since the elimination in 2005 of the graduated tax, which provided
   local governments with 5 percent of their total revenue and was important for discretionary expenditures, local
   governments have become dependent on non-discretionary central government transfers for 98 percent of their
   budget, reducing accountability to local citizens.
   Reduction in transfers to local government. Real per capita transfers from the central government to local
   governments fell by 13 percent from FY03 to FY08. Transfers to local governments as a percentage of public
   expenditure have declined from around 47 percent in FY02 to about 22 percent in FY09. Local governments are
   spending an increasing proportion of resources on non-discretionary wages and salaries.
   Increased percentage of conditional grants. Tied sector conditional grants have increased as a percentage of
   total transfers from central to local government, from 65.5 percent in FY06 to about 95 percent in FY10,
   making it difficult for local government to plan for and respond to local demand and needs.
   Creation of new districts. More than 25 new districts were created from 2004 to 2009, bringing the total to 90.
   The government continues to create new districts, purportedly to improve service delivery. In actuality, it
   increases the amount spent on salaries and administration costs, further reducing resources available for service
   delivery.
A possible new level of local government. A draft Regional Government Bill would create five regional
governments, which would be responsible for regional hospitals, secondary education, coordination, monitoring and
supervision of agriculture, and forest and land management.
Bank support to decentralization. The Bank is advising the government on the proposed regional governments
and on local government financing, including own-source revenue, the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system, and
possible borrowing. In addition, the Bank is supporting local government capacity building under the ongoing Local
Government Management Service Delivery project.

29.     Returning to and sustaining high per capita income growth in the medium and long
term will require acceleration of structural transformation. The economy would have to
transform from subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture, from farm production to non-farm
production, and from domestic markets to external markets. Non-farm activities in construction,
trading, informal manufacturing, low-level agroprocessing, and retail services have provided sources
of diversification of income, but need to be sustained to absorb the fast-growing labor force.

30.     Accelerating structural transformation will require further addressing the
infrastructure gap, especially in the energy and transport sectors. Better transport is needed to
improve connectivity from producers to markets and to improve the mobility of the labor force; and
industry needs reliable electricity. Better municipal infrastructure is needed to accommodate
urbanization associated with structural transformation. The labor force will also need to be equipped
with skills that meet the demands of a changing economic structure.

31.     For public investments to succeed, governance and value for money need to improve.
Waste and corruption threaten to undermine the quality and effectiveness of infrastructure
investments and service delivery. Public investments are also facing constraints in absorption
capacity and implementation, derailing the pro-growth fiscal stance. Uganda needs to strengthen
capacity to plan and implement investments and build a culture of accountability, with an emphasis
on eliminating waste. The country has made progress in strengthening procurement and public
                                                        -7-
financial management (PFM) laws, systems, and regulations, but more work is needed to strengthen
compliance. Improving efficiency of public spending is particularly urgent in the context of future oil
revenues.

32.     Oil production will change Uganda's economic outlook, although it is too early for
projections.6 Oil exploration companies have announced discoveries totaling at least 800 million
barrels of oil reserves, an amount comfortably above the threshold for commercial development.
Total basin potential is estimated at 2 billion barrels. Limited oil production could start as early as
2011 to be used for power generation. Full-scale production, which is not likely to begin before 2016,
could reach 150,000 barrels per day or more for ten to twenty years. Production at these levels would
generate revenues of over US$3 billion annually at today's crude oil prices, of which more than half
would accrue to the government as royalties and taxes. At these levels, Uganda, while significantly
affected by oil, will not be totally dependent on oil revenues. Uganda would be in the company of
countries such as Azerbaijan, Sudan, and Trinidad & Tobago, as opposed to classic petro-states such
as Angola, Equatorial Guinea, and Nigeria. Although full-scale production is unlikely to be reached
during this CAS period, the multi-billion dollar capital investment projects needed to develop the oil
exploitation sector will impact the economy. (For more information on oil, see Box 3 and Annex 6.)

33.      The government is preparing the institutional environment for oil production and
revenue management, but much remains to be done. In January 2008, the government issued a
National Oil and Gas Policy, which articulates a best-practice framework for managing petroleum
resources for sustainable economic development. The policy calls for the establishment of several
new institutions and structures, including: a Directorate of Petroleum to set and monitor policy; a
Petroleum Authority to regulate the sector; a national oil company to hold the state's direct
investment in oil projects; and a Petroleum Fund under the management of the Central Bank to
stabilize the revenue flow to the budget. The policy also calls for revising the petroleum law and
corresponding regulations to handle the development and production of oil and gas, appropriately
capture recent trends and best practice in the industry, and harmonize with a future revenue
management law. The government is in the process of producing enabling legislation.

34.     Oil brings opportunities and challenges. Oil production is likely to increase foreign direct
investment and domestic revenue and increase energy supply. But it may also bring inflationary
pressures, exchange rate appreciation, and new governance challenges. The so-called "Dutch
Disease" effect may reduce the competitiveness of Uganda's agricultural exports and complicate the
country's growth strategy, making value addition, export diversification, and manufacturing harder to
achieve. The National Oil and Gas Policy emphasizes that oil revenue will be used for strategic
public investments, which could help increase productivity in other sectors and offset Dutch Disease.

   Given the uncertainty around timing and volume of oil production, the figures provided should be treated as
illustrations of the possible impact of oil, not as projections.

                              Box 3: Development of Oil Resources in Uganda
Oil Discoveries and Potential: Since 2006, UK-based Tullow Oil and its partner Heritage Oil have made a series of
large oil discoveries in the Lake Albert Rift Basin in western Uganda. Tullow Oil estimates the total oil discovered
at over 800 million barrels, and estimates total basin oil potential at 2 billion barrels.
This level of reserves would put Uganda into a peer group with Chad (0.9 billion barrels), Republic of Congo (1.9
billion), Equatorial Guinea (1.7 billion) and Gabon (3.2 billion), but far short of Angola (13.5 billion), and Nigeria
(36.2 billion).
Oil Revenue: Peak production is likely to be about 150,000 to 200,000 barrels per day for 10-20 years. Based on the
current fiscal system and assuming an oil price of US$75 per barrel, government revenue at peak production could
be over US$2 billion per year. By way of comparison, government revenue in 2008 was US$2.6 billion and GDP
was US$14 billion.
Timing: There is a high level of uncertainty regarding the time frame for reaching peak oil production and revenue
generation. Huge investments in infrastructure--estimated at US$10 billion--will be needed to produce, transport,
export, and refine the oil. Oil specialists estimate that peak production is likely to begin no earlier than 2016.
A first phase of limited production (perhaps 10,000 to 15,000 barrels per day) could begin in 2010-2012. Some
limited quantities of natural gas could also be produced for a 50 MW power plant. Nevertheless, government
revenue during this early production phase would be negligible.
Challenges: Development of Uganda's oil will be complex for several reasons:
  Oil characteristics: The oil is contained in low-pressure reservoirs, which will increase the complexity and cost
  of production facilities. While light and low in sulphur, the oil has high paraffin content. Pipelines will need to be
  heated for the oil to flow. Refineries will need expensive processing and treating capacity. Also, much of the oil
  extends offshore under Lake Albert. While initial production will take place on land, future developments will
  necessarily move offshore, resulting in increased cost, complexity, and environmental sensitivity. Some offshore
  fields may be uneconomic to exploit.
  Environment: Strict environmental protection requirements will be needed: oilfields are located in and around
  Lake Albert and the Murchison Falls Conservation Area.
  Production sharing contracts: Foreign investors hold their blocks by means of production sharing agreements
  (PSAs) signed with the government between 1997 and 2005. Under the PSAs, the private investors bear the cost
  and risk of exploration and development in exchange for a defined share of oil production in the case of success.
  To date, the government has not disclosed the terms of the PSAs, leading to criticism from NGOs and others.
  Local communities: Addressing local community issues and compensation will pose a challenge given Uganda's
  tradition of communal land ownership, unclear national land policy and regulation, and the possibility that
  speculators will attempt to profit from changes in land values.
  Transborder issues: Transborder issues with the DRC, such as allocation of resources, transport, security, and
  environmental management, could give rise to difficult negotiations or even conflict given incomplete border
  demarcation and a history of difficult relations between the two countries.
  Pipeline and refinery development: Pipeline and refinery development: Exporting oil would require construction
  of a 1,300 km export pipeline to an Indian Ocean port at a cost of some US$2-3 billion. A large domestic refinery
  would have a similar cost. Under either the export or refining option, forming the investment consortium and
  concluding the necessary commercial and financing agreements will be a complicated and time consuming
  process. Construction time for either the pipeline or the refinery would be roughly three years.
Bank Support: Given the many uncertainties at this stage regarding petroleum sector development, the Bank
program will be necessarily flexible. All Bank analytical work under the CAS will take into consideration petroleum
sector issues. Annual policy notes on the petroleum sector will provide just-in-time advice to the government on key
topics. The Bank and government are discussing a possible Petroleum Sector Support Project (FY12). The Bank will
provide further support during the CAS period as requested by the government and as more information becomes
available on petroleum sector developments.

Debt Sustainability

35.     Uganda's risk of debt distress is low, according to a recent update (March 2010) of the
Joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis. Its debt ratios have improved substantially
due to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative and to
prudent macroeconomic management. The government plans to only gradually increase use of non-
concessional borrowing to finance public infrastructure investments as they build debt management
capacity. The analysis indicates that debt sustainability is sensitive to shocks, such as deterioration of
economic growth. To minimize risk, the government needs to carefully select and implement public
investment projects to accelerate economic growth at reasonable fiscal costs. The next Joint IMF-
World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis is planned for March 2011.

                                   C. Key Development Challenges

36.     Accelerating structural transformation. The country's uninterrupted growth since 1987
has been a noteworthy achievement. However, the weak point of economic performance has been the
limited shift from a low-productivity, primary-based economy to a high-productivity economy based
on industry and services. The country's high population growth rate makes structural transformation
particularly urgent to create nonagricultural and higher-productivity jobs for one of the fastest
growing labor forces in the world.

37.     Alleviating infrastructure and other bottlenecks. Inadequate infrastructure, especially
transport and energy, is Uganda's binding constraint for growth and economic transformation. The
government needs to identify and facilitate implementation of infrastructure projects that will induce
private sector investment in new products, resulting in increased exports and new jobs. Also, the
financial sector needs to deepen and contribute more to growth. Lending as a share of deposits
remains low. Pension reform is needed to create longer-term private investment financing.

38.     Raising agricultural productivity and value addition. The government needs to continue
supporting technology adoption to reduce the gap between yields achieved in farm trials and average
national yields, and also improve value chain linkages through promoting agro-processing and public
private partnerships. It is increasingly recognized that other core public functions, such as animal and
plant disease control, regulatory services, water for agricultural production, sector statistics, and
monitoring and evaluation, require support to ensure enduring agricultural growth.

39.     Managing urbanization for growth. The pace of Uganda's structural transformation will
also depend on the efficiency of its spatial transformation. Although Uganda's current level of
urbanization is low, the rate of urban growth is high--estimated at 5.9 percent annually. Further
agglomerations of people and economic activity will accompany structural transformation. Uganda
has an opportunity to proactively strengthen decentralization and urban management to maximize the
economic opportunities inherent in urbanization.

40.     Reintegrating the North. Spurring economic recovery in northern Uganda is important for
growth and poverty reduction, as well as for political stability. Development challenges in the north
are acute: the region has the highest incidence of female-headed households in the country at 31
percent; and the infant mortality rate was 106 per 1,000 live births in 2006, compared to the national
average of 76. Yet, northern Uganda has high potential for agricultural production and exports, given
its proximity to markets in the DRC and southern Sudan. Ongoing investments in infrastructure and
improvements in service delivery coordinated through the government's Northern Uganda Peace
Recovery and Development Plan and the Karamoja Integrated Disarmament and Development Plan
will help harness this potential.
                                                  - 10 -
41.     Addressing the demographic challenge. Uganda could generate a demographic dividend
for economic growth by accelerating the transition from high to low fertility and mortality rates.7 To
achieve this, Uganda would need to improve its policies to reduce fertility and child and infant
mortality and increase access to and quality of education, especially for girls.

42.      Addressing the youth challenge. Nearly 400,000 youth enter the labor force each year; and
their absorption into the labor market will remain a challenge for the medium term. To assist youth
transition to stable employment, it will be important to raise the primary completion rate to near 100
percent, improve employment opportunities in the wage sector, and support youth in their transition
to employment in the non-wage sector. (See Annex 7 for a full discussion on the youth challenge.)

43.     Arresting environmental degradation and natural resource depletion. Despite efforts to
improve institutions for environmental management and sustainable use of natural resources, the
depletion of Uganda's natural resources and degradation of the environment is constraining growth.
There is a high level of deforestation, while household expenditures for charcoal and fuelwood,
principal sources of energy, have doubled during the last 15 years. Fishery resources, an important
export, are declining. Other renewable natural resources--water resources, wetlands, grasslands,
farmlands, and biodiversity--are being similarly depleted. Climate change will further challenge
natural resource management.

44.     Addressing a weakening governance environment. Uganda improved the quality of
governance in the early part of the decade by strengthening accountability sector institutions,
introducing decentralization, and accelerating public sector and public financial management reform.
However, despite considerable transparency and a strong anti-corruption legal framework,
accountability and enforcement are low. According to a 2009 Africa Peer Review Mechanism
Country Review of Uganda, petty and high-level corruption are prevalent and affect every institution
in the country, and are most rife in procurement, privatization, administration of revenues and public
expenditures, and public service delivery. Despite the government's zero tolerance policy on
corruption, few if any high-level officials involved in major corruption scandals have been tried,
hindering attempts to raise the bar and address lower level corruption. Reinvigorating institutions and
accountability systems, rethinking decentralization policies, in particular fiscal aspects, and re-
launching stalled public service reform processes will be essential elements for the development
agenda in the coming years, especially before oil revenues come on stream.

45.     Avoiding the so-called "resource curse." Uganda's overriding development challenge is to
manage its oil endowment for stability, prosperity, and sustainability. Success will depend largely on
the government's near-term policy decisions, especially regarding resource management, revenue
management, and environmental management. Effective petroleum sector governance requires the
establishment of a clear and transparent legal, regulatory, and policy framework. The government
must also manage public expectations regarding the future benefits coming from oil production and
take steps to assure that the oil-affected communities feel the development benefits of oil.




7
  When the fertility rate falls and the youth dependency ratios declines, the workforce becomes relatively larger,
opening a window for faster human capital development and economic growth--known as the demographic
dividend.

                  II. GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND DEVELOPMENT PARTNER SUPPORT

                              A. Uganda's Poverty Reduction Strategy

46.     Uganda was the first country to prepare a comprehensive, participatory, and country-
owned national development strategy in 1997, creating the model for the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper. The 1997 Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) received international praise. It
was revised and updated in 2000 (PEAP II) and 2004 (PEAP III). PEAP III was extended for two
years, to June 2010, due to delays in preparing its successor.

47.    In February 2010, the government finalized a new five-year (FY2011-2015) National
Development Plan (NDP). The NDP's main theme is "Growth, Employment and Socio-Economic
Transformation for Prosperity," marking a broadening of the country's development strategy from
poverty reduction, the focus of the PEAPs, to structural transformation to raise growth and living
standards. It is the first in a series of six plans intended to transform Uganda over thirty years into a
modern and prosperous country.

48.     The NDP has eight objectives. These are: (i) increase household income and promote
equity; (ii) enhance the availability and quality of gainful employment; (iii) enhance human capital
development; (iv) improve the stock and quality of economic infrastructure; (v) increase access to
quality social services, (vi) promote science, technology, innovation, and information and
communications technology (ICT) to enhance competitiveness; (vii) strengthen good governance,
defense, and security; and (viii) promote sustainable population and use of the environment and
natural resources. In addition, the NDP identifies four priority areas for investment: infrastructure
development; human resource development; critical production inputs; and science, technology, and
innovation. The NDP identifies fifteen "national flagship projects" intended to address binding
constraints to growth.

49.     The NDP includes analysis of cross-cutting issues crucial to sustained growth, such as
gender. It highlights gender inequalities, commits to mainstreaming gender-responsive development,
and proposes strategies to address gender gaps (see Box 4). Other cross-cutting issues include:
governance, urbanization and decentralization, climate change, and regional cooperation. The NDP
also includes a detailed discussion by sector, including a situational analysis, constraints, objectives,
and planned interventions.

50.      The IDA-IMF Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) considers both the macroeconomic
framework and the sector-specific plans to be generally compatible with the government's
vision of structurally transforming the economy. The JSAN also notes that weak governance and
exogenous shocks could affect implementation adversely. The JSAN recommends measures to
strengthen the NDP and enhance its implementation, such as better prioritization; actions to make
growth more inclusive; preserving space for private sector initiatives and strengthening the legal and
fiscal framework for public-private partnerships (PPPs); and including indicators of improving public
financial management and governance in the NDP monitoring and evaluation plan.




                                                 - 12 -
                                     Box 4: Gender Inequality in Uganda
Uganda's constitution guarantees gender equality and includes a number of affirmative action measures; however, as
noted in Uganda's National Development Plan (NDP), gender perceptions and practices continue to perpetuate
inequalities that hinder economic development. The NDP introduces a comprehensive framework for mainstreaming
gender-responsive development within the country's objectives. It is informed by the National Gender Policy (2007)
and the National Action Plan on Women.
Based on the NDP's gender analysis and the World Bank's "Gender and Growth Assessment for Uganda" (2005),
the key gender-based barriers to economic growth and poverty reduction are:
 Women are marginalized in business ownership, skills development, access to financial resources, non-
 agricultural employment, and inheritance rights.
 There is a marked gender gap in access to and control over productive resources. Women comprise 70 percent of
 the work force in agriculture but have unequal access to and control over productive resources, such as land,
 limiting their ability to move beyond subsistence agriculture.
 Women have lower access to health and education services. There are gender disparities in primary school
 completion as well as secondary school enrollment. Only a third of girls enrolled in primary education continue
 in school to the age of 18, compared to half of boys
 Early marriages and low girl primary school completion and secondary school enrollment are principal
 contributors to a high fertility rate and a high maternal mortality rate.
During the CAS period, Bank-financed operations will be designed to reflect differences in men's and women's
needs and constraints to ensure equal participation and equitable distribution of benefits. The CAS includes specific
interventions to address gender inequalities in business skill development, education, health care, and agricultural
production. The CAS results framework includes gender-disaggregated indicators in these areas.


NDP Objectives 1 and 2: Income, Equity, and Employment

51.     The NDP identifies eight primary growth sectors--agriculture, forestry, manufacturing,
oil and gas, tourism, mining, ICT, and construction. The NDP calls for using national resources,
better infrastructure, and development projects to ensure that all regions benefit from the growth of
the national economy.

52.     The private sector is constrained mainly by poor infrastructure and difficulty in
accessing credit. The NDP notes that "Doing Business 2010" ranks Uganda 112th out of 183
countries. To improve conditions for private sector growth, the NDP calls for improving economic
infrastructure, enhancing human capital development, strengthening competitiveness, and improving
the private sector regulatory framework.

53.     The NDP acknowledges agriculture as a key sector for growth, exports, employment,
and food security. It provides the basis for growth in other sectors such as manufacturing and
services. The NDP focuses on boosting agricultural production and productivity by increasing
agroprocessing and strengthening policies and institutions.

NDP Objective 4: Economic Infrastructure

54.     Recognizing that weak infrastructure is a binding constraint for trade and growth, the
NDP gives priority to improving infrastructure, especially energy and transport. The road
sector carries 96 percent of total cargo freight, but only 4 percent is paved. Railways carry only 3.5
percent of freight cargo and only 28 percent of it is functional. Only 11 percent of the population has
access to electricity. The NDP identifies several flagship projects to address these gaps, including

                                                       - 13 -
railway construction and rehabilitation, development of Kampala rapid transport systems,
improvement of water transport on Lake Victoria, and construction of new hydropower plants.

55.      The NDP also emphasizes the need to increase access to water for production. It notes
the potential negative impact of climate change on agricultural yields. The construction of five large-
scale irrigation systems is a national flagship project.

NDP Objectives 3 and 5: Human Capital Development and Access to Social Services

56.    While some progress has been made in recent years, Uganda's health outcomes remain
poor, even in comparison to other SSA countries. The health sector suffers from inadequate
funding, understaffed health centers, health worker absenteeism, and waste in drug supply. The NDP
emphasizes preventive and curative care, while exploring synergies with other sectors, such as
education and water and sanitation, to reduce preventable diseases. It also focuses on addressing
performance gaps by tackling health care systems and management, strengthening human resource
planning, ensuring availability of drugs, and expanding access to Uganda's National Minimum
Health Care Package.

57.     Education has been a priority since 1997, when the government introduced universal
primary education. The government launched a phased universal post-primary education and
training program in 2006, and has launched reforms to address quality. Nevertheless, widespread
absenteeism, inequitable teacher deployment, insufficient spread of instructional materials, and weak
governance structures at the school levels hinder the quality of service delivery.

58.    The NDP also identifies skills development as a priority. The NDP notes the rapidly
growing labor force and the high level of drop-outs from primary and secondary schools. In response,
the government intends to develop a national vocational program.

NDP Objective 6: Science, Technology, Innovation, and ICT

59.     The NDP recognizes the role of science, technology, and innovation in growth and
socioeconomic transformation. The NDP calls for the establishment of regional centers to adapt
and promote new technology and provision of incentives to the private sector to encourage
innovation. The government plans to improve ICT infrastructure by extending the national fiber-
optic network to all districts and by introducing e-government services, including e-procurement.

NDP Objective 7: Good Governance, Defense, and Security

60.      The NDP identifies the weak public sector as a major constraint to development.
Institutional inefficiency and ineffectiveness resulting from poor planning and management and
limited staffing lead to low absorption of public funds and poor delivery of services. The NDP also
recognizes the devastating socio-economic effects of corruption. It notes that Uganda is ranked 130th
out of 180 countries in Transparency International's 2009 Corruption Perception Index, below many
other African countries.

61.     The NDP identifies a number of key actions to address institutional weaknesses and
governance challenges. This includes using the NDP as a key document to ensure alignment with all
sectors plans, improve policy coordination, introduce institutional performance contracts at all levels,
improve human resource management of public servants, review pay and incentives systems, and
improve coordination and cooperation with the private sector and civil society. The NDP aims to


                                                 - 14 -
increase transparency and accountability by introducing value for money performance standards and
performance budgeting in all sectors.

NDP Objective 8: Promote Sustainable Population and Use of Environment and Natural
Resources

62.     The NDP recognizes that current population trends pose challenges to future growth
and structural transformation unless actions are taken to generate a population dividend. It
notes that high fertility results from low levels of education, early child bearing, a low contraceptive
prevalence rate of 24 percent, and a high unmet demand for family planning estimated at 41 percent.
The NDP identifies several key areas for intervention: implementation of the national population
policy (including mobilization of resources); increasing access to and availability of family planning
and reproductive health care; and increasing enrollment of youth and adults in education and training
programs to increase the availability of skilled labor.

63.     Uganda's natural resources and biodiversity are deteriorating due to population
pressures and economic activity. The country has the sixth highest deforestation rate among 62
tropical countries--losing one quarter of its forests from 1990 to 2005. Fish production fell by 14
percent from 2004 to 2007, and biodiversity is declining. By 2017, Uganda could be a water stressed
country. Recognizing the productivity effects on agriculture, industry, and fisheries, the NDP calls
for restoring degraded ecosystems, ensuring sustainable management of environmental resources,
increasing public awareness, and enforcing environmental laws and regulations.

                                   B. Development Partner Support

64.     Uganda is highly dependent on development assistance. Official Development Assistance
(ODA) increased from US$192 million in 1986 to US$1.7 billion in 2007.8 Relative to GDP, total
ODA to Uganda stood at 5 percent in 1986, peaked at 25 percent in 1992, and averaged 14 percent
from 2004 to 2008. On-budget donor support amounted in FY08 and FY09 to about US$800 million
per year; thus, donors finance around 30 percent of the government's budget.

65.     More than 40 bilateral and multilateral development partners (DPs) provide aid to
Uganda; but only three DPs account for almost half of total ODA. The World Bank, the single
largest financier, accounted for 19 percent of the US$7.3 billion disbursed from 2004 to 2008. The
United States accounted for 18 percent; and the European Commission accounted for 10 percent. The
number of small donors creates a challenge for lowering the transaction costs of donor assistance: 12
DPs accounted for 90 percent of ODA over the period; while 30 DPs accounted for the remaining 10
percent.

66.     There have been efforts since the 1990s to improve donor harmonization. The
government and DPs signed a set of Partnership Principles in 2003, which emphasized the
government's preference to use budget support as an aid modality. Over the last decade, in line with
government preferences, DPs have shifted increasingly from project support to budget and sector
support. In 2007, 66 percent of disbursed aid was provided as either general budget support or within
program-based approaches, up from 50 percent in 2005.



8
  ODA is measured by donors as expenditures that have as their main objective the promotion of the economic
development and welfare of developing countries. What is classified as ODA to Uganda will not equal the amount
received by the Government of Uganda.
                                                    - 15 -
67.     In 2005, seven DPs joined together to elaborate a Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy
(UJAS) to support the government's 2004 PEAP. Five additional DPs joined the UJAS framework
in 2006, bringing the total number of UJAS partners to twelve.9 It was the first joint assistance
strategy of its kind, representing a commitment among DPs to improve harmonization and aid
effectiveness.

68.     A review of the UJAS concluded that transaction costs were not reduced.10 The
development of a joint assistance strategy was well intended, but in retrospect was neither a
necessary nor sufficient condition for more effective aid. For example, while the UJAS outlined joint
development partner commitments and aspirations to work more effectively towards the achievement
of the PEAP goals and objectives, the UJAS was not effective as an operational tool during
implementation. Consequently, UJAS partners and other DPs decided to engage with government on
the development of on-the-ground mechanisms to improve aid coordination and alignment with
national priorities, rather than on developing joint strategic documents.




9
  The initial seven UJAS partners comprised: the African Development Bank, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the World Bank Group. Five DPs signed up to the UJAS in 2006: Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and the European Commission.

     III. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UGANDA JOINT ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND LESSONS LEARNED

69.    World Bank Executive Directors discussed the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy
(UJAS) in January 2006 (Report number 34310-UG). Part 1 of the UJAS covered a joint DP
assessment and strategy, and Part 2 covered the World Bank Group assistance program.

70.     The UJAS adopted the five pillars of Uganda's 2004 Poverty Eradication Action Plan
(PEAP). These were: (i) economic management, with a focus on macroeconomic stability consistent
with rapid private sector-led growth; (ii) enhancing production, competitiveness, and incomes; (iii)
security, conflict resolution, and disaster management; (iv) good governance; and (v) human
development. Within these five pillars, the UJAS identified 15 high-level strategic objectives, 40
outcomes, and 56 outcome indicators.

71.     The UJAS Completion Report rates Bank achievements under the UJAS as moderately
satisfactory. Pillar 1 (economic management) and pillar 3 (security, conflict resolution, and disaster
management) were rated satisfactory; while pillar 2 (enhancing production, competitiveness, and
incomes) and pillar 5 (human development) were rated moderately satisfactory. Pillar 4 (good
governance) was rated moderately unsatisfactory. A Country Assistance Evaluation by the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rated World Bank support during the period 2000-2007
(covering the FY01-03 CAS and the first two years of the UJAS) as moderately satisfactory (see Box
5). In 2008, the Bank contracted a client survey to provide information on perceptions of the Bank's
work in Uganda, which revealed that most stakeholders surveyed would like the Bank to focus on
infrastructure and play a leading role in fighting corruption (see Box 6). See Annex 19 for the full
UJAS Completion Report.

                     Box 5: Uganda Joint Country Assistance Evaluation, 2001-2007

The World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) and the Operations Evaluation Department of the African
Development Bank produced a Joint Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) dated March 19, 2009, covering the
period 2000 to 2007, corresponding to the FY01-03 CAS and the first two years of the UJAS.
IEG Findings. World Bank programs were substantially effective in decentralization, public sector reform, growth
and economic transformation, education, and water and sanitation. IEG deemed that more could have been done to
help counter the perception of increasing corruption, improve power supply, reduce transport costs, enhance
agricultural productivity, and help with family planning and reproductive health. The CAE rated the overall
outcome of World Bank support as moderately satisfactory.
IEG Recommendations and Corresponding Country Team Actions:
(i) Support the government in developing an analytical framework to guide governance reforms. Action: The Bank
    and DPs are developing a Data Tracking Mechanism.
(ii) Encourage and support government efforts to develop medium-to-long term master plans for infrastructure.
     Action: The Bank has supported a Power Sector Investment Plan; a National Transport Master Plan, including a
     Transport Master Plan for Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area; and a 15-year investment plan (2008 - 2023) for
     all modes of transport. The Bank will also support a Rural Electrification Strategy.
(iii) Encourage the government to coordinate ongoing monitoring and evaluation initiatives by its development
      partners to ensure reliable monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of its overall poverty reduction strategy. Action:
      The government, whose PEAP evaluation identified weak and uncoordinated M&E as a factor hindering policy
      evaluation and decision making, is drafting a national policy on public sector M&E to address legislative gaps,
      clarify roles and responsibilities, and enforce institutional accountability for service delivery.
(iv) Reinforce the effectiveness of general budget support as an instrument for minimizing transaction costs and
     facilitating the use of country systems. Action: The Bank and DPs have developed a Joint Budget Support
     Framework.

Methodology. From May to July 2008, about 550 stakeholders of the World Bank in Uganda were invited to
provide their opinions on the Bank's assistance to the country. 306 stakeholders (56%) responded to the survey.
Survey results:
 Respondents across most stakeholder groups and all geographic locations believed that the Bank considered its
 top priority in Uganda to be ensuring macroeconomic stability consistent with rapid growth.
 Respondents indicated that it would be most productive for the Bank to focus most of its resources on
 strengthening basic infrastructure.
 Respondents felt that the Bank should play a leading role in fighting corruption (mean response rating of 5.2 on a
 6-point scale, where 1 is "not at all" and 6 is to "a great degree").
 The majority of respondents felt that the Bank should be more involved in Uganda's development strategies; 20%
 felt that the Bank is currently involved at an optimum level. Only 8% of respondents felt that the Bank should be
 less involved or should not be involved at all.
 Respondents felt that the Bank's policy and economic advice and financial resources were its greatest values. The
 Bank's lending when others won't, donor coordination, knowledge, and technical advice were also considered of
 great value.
 Respondents felt that the Bank's greatest weaknesses in its work in Uganda were imposing theoretical and
 technocratic solutions without regard to political and other realities and being too bureaucratic in its operational
 policies and procedures
 Across all respondents, the Bank's overall effectiveness in Uganda received a mean rating of 6.3 on a 10-point
 scale, with 1 being very unfavorable and 10 being very favorable. Ratings were highest from employees of
 ministries (7.0), local government (7.2), and other organizations (7.4) and lowest from nongovernmental
 organizations (4.9).

IDA, Trust Funds, and Analytical and Advisory Activities

72.    World Bank Executive Directors approved about US$1.3 billion in IDA during the
UJAS period (FY06-09) for seventeen operations. Budget support operations (Poverty Reduction
Support Credits) amounted to US$460 million--35 percent of total lending.11

73.   In terms of net commitments, the Uganda portfolio is the sixth largest in the Africa
Region. As of end January 2010, there are sixteen IDA-financed operations with a net commitment
amount of US$1.3 billion. In addition, there are five regional projects and an IDA guarantee of
US$115 million for the Private Power Generation (Bujagali) Project.

74.     The current sector distribution of IDA commitments reflects the government's
emphasis on infrastructure. About 68 percent of commitments are allocated to energy, mining,
environment, urban development, and transport. About 22 percent are allocated to education and
social development; 8 percent to finance and private sector development; and 1 percent to economic
and public sector management.12 (Annex 8 provides a summary of the Operations Portfolio.)

75.     Overall, project implementation performance has been satisfactory. The portfolio
disbursement rate is 28.5 percent, versus the Africa Region average of 18.5 percent. There are one


11
   The three PRSCs were: PRSC-5 in FY06; PRSC-6 in FY07; and PRSC-7 in FY08, which also provided funding
for FY09 under an exceptional two-tranche design to align the PRSP with the Joint Budget Support Framework.
12
   Uganda is currently in between PRSC cycles. When there is a PRSC in the active portfolio, the allocation to
economic and public sector manager increases to about 9 percent.
                                                       - 18 -
potential and two actual problem projects, resulting in commitments at risk of 4.9 percent, much less
than the Africa Region average of 28 percent.13 IEG project ratings of projects exiting the portfolio
have been largely consistent with Implementation Completion Report ratings. However, delays in
IDA credit effectiveness caused by Uganda's lengthy approval process have often resulted in cost
overruns and project delays.14 Of the seventeen projects under implementation at the start of FY09,
six had effectiveness delays of 200 days or more. On average, effectiveness took 185 days. (Annex 9
provides selected indicators of the Bank portfolio.)

76.     Uganda benefitted during the UJAS from 48 trust funds providing nearly US$65 million
in grants. Most were linked to lending operations. They focused mainly on: environment (GEF);
renewable energy (GEF); demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants (MDTF); avian
influenza; sanitation and hygiene (WSP); monitoring and evaluation (IDF); and piloting output-based
aid in health and water supply (GPOBA). (A list of active trust funds is shown in Annex 10.)

77.     The Bank's analytical and advisory activities (AAAs) underpinned investment
operations and sector strategies, and informed the government's reform path. Analytical work
included the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM, FY07), which helped the government shift
toward investments to accelerate economic growth and structural transformation. The CEM was
followed by a strategically planned series of public expenditure reviews (PERs), focusing on
education (FY08), health (FY09), and roads (FY10). The report "Public Finance Management in
Uganda ­ a Platform Approach" (2008), including an assessment of fiscal decentralization and the
PEFA Report (FY09) has informed the public finance management reform agenda. Other AAA
includes: a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, an Investment Climate Assessment, a Financial
Sector Study, a Land Poverty and Social Impact Assessment, an Agriculture Sector PER, and a study
on Regional Inequality.

78.     A recent Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) identified portfolio issues and
actions to improve portfolio performance and disbursements. The CPPR, which concluded in
February 2010, recommended actions to improve quality at entry; build project implementation
capacity, especially procurement; reduce effectiveness delays; and increase attention to
environmental and social safeguard issues. The full CPPR Action Plan is shown in Annex 11. A
CPPR Progress Report is planned for September 2010.

The International Finance Corporation

79.      IFC investment commitments over the CAS period (FY 2006-2009) amounted to
US$201 million for eleven projects. Investments were mainly in the electricity sector (US$155
million) and the financial sector, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and
telecommunications. Since 2006, the IFC has focused on intermediaries for SME finance, resulting in
improved portfolio performance with negligible loss reserves. Currently, the portfolio amounts to
US$193 million, the fourth largest country portfolio for IFC in Africa (see Annex 12 for additional
details). IFC initiated 14 advisory projects during the period with a total value of US$7.6 million. In
many cases, these advisory projects complemented investments to broaden development impact, for
example supporting distributor networks and the Village Phone model with cell phone operators;
working with banks to build capacity for SME lending, including facilities targeting women


13
   Actual project projects have Project Development Objective (PDO) or Implementation Progress (IP) ratings of
moderately unsatisfactory or lower. Potential problem projects are those with PDO or IP ratings of moderately
satisfactory or higher, but have three or more risk flags.

   Under Ugandan law, parliament approves each loan or credit.

entrepreneurs, and expanding housing finance. Other areas included assistance to improve the
investment climate, address constraints for businesswomen, promote foreign investment, and develop
models for private participation in small-scale rural water and electricity provision. Uganda also
benefited from IFC's advisory work to structure the private concession for Kenya Railways, which
was extended to incorporate Uganda Railways in a single concession.

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency

80.      During the UJAS period, MIGA became increasingly involved in Bank group energy
projects. MIGA is supporting Globeleq Holdings (United Kingdom) with a US$41 million guarantee
of its investment in Umeme Ltd, the project company that has leased the electricity distribution grid
of Uganda for 20 years. MIGA is also supporting Sithe Global (USA) with a US$115 million
guarantee of its equity in Bujagali Energy Ltd. MIGA has a third guarantee in support of
agribusiness. In all, MIGA's portfolio of three guarantees has a combined gross exposure of US$158
million.

Lessons Learned

81.    The CAS Completion Report identified the following key lessons, which are
incorporated in this CAS:
   (i) Focus on fewer outcomes and ensure a clear results framework. Typical of many early-
       generation results-focused CASes, the UJAS included an unrealistic number of outcomes
       (40) and indicators (56), which reduced the Bank's strategic focus and ability to track its own
       effectiveness. In addition, both the UJAS and the PEAP had weak and incomplete results
       frameworks.
   (ii) Strengthen support to improve governance and help the government identify and track
        governance indicators to guide governance interventions. Focus on country-specific
        actionable governance indicators rather than on perception-based and cross-country
        comparative indicators.
   (iii) PRSC reforms should be linked to sector strategies and specific sector operations. Long-
         term sector reforms are best tackled when addressed simultaneously by a development policy
         operation and a sector specific operation.
   (iv) Focus on developing on-the-ground mechanisms to improve aid coordination and
        alignment with national priorities, rather than on joint strategic documents. The
        development of a joint assistance strategy was well intended, but it did not increase aid
        effectiveness nor reduce transaction costs for the government or DPs.
   (v) Anticipate at the project design stage the possibility of delays in credit effectiveness, due
       to delays in Uganda's approval process. In addition, the Bank should ensure that
       government informs parliament about proposed projects at the appraisal stage, and puts in
       place a mechanism to track the approval process.

                        IV. THE WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

82.     The CAS aims to support Uganda's vision of structural transformation by selectively
assisting the government in implementing the NDP. The CAS provides a framework for World
Bank Group support to Uganda over five years, from FY11-15, in alignment with the five-year NDP.

                  A. The Framework for World Bank Engagement in Uganda

83.     Align with national priorities. The CAS supports the implementation of the NDP and
relevant sector strategies and regional strategies, such as the Northern Uganda Peace Recovery and
Development Plan and the Karamoja Integrated Disarmament and Development Plan. CAS outcomes
are a subset of NDP outcomes, focusing on areas where Bank interventions will contribute
measurably to NDP outcomes. The Bank considered the views of a range of stakeholders during CAS
preparation (see Annex 13, summarizing CAS consultations).

84.     Maintain flexibility to mitigate risks. The first twelve months of CAS implementation will
take place within a pre-election environment with inherent uncertainties and governance risks (see
Section VI: Risks and Mitigation). The recent discovery of oil further increases political and
governance risks. A CAS Progress Report will be prepared in FY13, or earlier if required, to update
and adjust the CAS program as needed.

85.     Continue to improve donor harmonization and reduce transaction costs for the
government. Development partners in Uganda continue to seek ways to further improve aid
effectiveness. Recognizing the limitations of the UJAS, DPs are focusing on basket funds, sector-
wide approaches, and new coordination mechanisms, such as the Joint Budget Support Framework
(see also Box 7), rather than on collective documents.

86.     Strengthen strategic partnerships. The Bank will complement its core program by
establishing strategic partnerships through single- and multi-donor trust funds and co-financing
arrangements. This will enable the Bank to leverage its own resources and capacity for greater
impact on the ground.

87.     Enhance World Bank Group cooperation. The electricity sector is an example of close
collaboration between IDA, IFC, and MIGA. IDA worked to restructure the sector and establish the
framework for private participation; IFC helped to structure the Private Power Generation (Bujagali)
Project, and IDA, IFC, and MIGA financing instruments were combined to realize the financing.
The three Bank Group entities also provide joint support to the electricity distribution company,
Umeme. During the CAS period, the World Bank Group will further enhance collaboration focusing
on three areas: infrastructure (energy and transport); private sector development and business
environment; and commercialization of agriculture.

88.     Enhance regional integration. The number of regional projects has increased from one
project in FY01 to an expected six projects by the end of FY10, reflecting an increasing emphasis on
regional integration that will continue under the CAS. The proposed CAS program includes regional
analytical work and projects to help Uganda increase growth through regional integration.

89.     Strengthen institutional capacity. Lending operations will include components as needed to
build or strengthen institutional capacity, including joint analytical work with local think tanks,
research centers, and academia (such as the Economic Policy Research Center, Makerere University)
to both support and strengthen them. Through an Institutional Development Fund grant (FY10,
                                               - 21 -
US$500,000), the Bank will also support the Diaspora Division within the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, which aims to use Uganda's diaspora to build institutional capacity in energy, roads, and
railways.

90.     Strengthen attention to governance and value for money. Given its cross-cutting nature,
governance and value for money is addressed under various CAS outcomes. A Governance
Partnership Facility (GPF) Window 1 grant (US$1.48 million) will help intensify attention to
governance and anti-corruption (GAC) under this CAS. A Governance Risk Assessment Matrix,
which summarizes risks, opportunities, gaps, and planned actions, will be monitored during the CAS
(see Annex 14). A core Bank governance team in the Uganda Country Office will meet periodically
to assess GAC initiatives and adjust them as needed. GAC initiatives to be undertaken during the
CAS include: 15

       (i) Enhance the focus on governance in sector projects, using them as entry points. The
           Bank will undertake political economy analysis and sector GAC assessments to design
           customized approaches to addressing governance risks that impede outcomes. During FY10,
           a GPF Window 2 grant was used to undertake political economy studies of the health and
           agriculture sectors, and a GAC assessment of the health and roads sectors. The analyses
           informed sector dialogue, were integrated into project design, and were used to prepare
           Governance and Anti-corruption Action Plans (GAAPs) that were adopted by the
           corresponding ministries. A GPF Window 1 grant provides funds to continue this approach
           during the CAS period, including for energy (in the context of oil exploitation) and local
           government/decentralization (in the context of moves towards recentralization and increased
           challenges to effective service delivery). GAAPs will be reassessed after one year of
           implementation.

       (ii) Continue to build demand-side mechanisms into project design. Five out of the sixteen
            ongoing IDA-financed investment projects already include demand-side mechanisms, such as
            citizen report cards. Demand-side mechanisms will be used during the CAS period whenever
            feasible. In addition, the Bank will test third-party monitoring of project implementation and
            results by a civil society organization.

       (iii) Increase transparency and disclosure of project activities to encourage citizen
             monitoring. In response to views expressed at CAS consultations, the Bank will increase
             public communication to ensure that project beneficiaries have access to information about
             budgets, contracts, and expected results. The Bank will initiate this approach with selected
             operations: Agriculture Technology and Agribusiness Advisory Services; Health Systems
             Strengthening; and Northern Uganda Social Action Fund II.

       (iv) Launch a Data Tracking Mechanism (DTM)--a GAC monitoring tool using actionable
            and country-specific indicators. The DTM was designed to use national data, such as
            reports of the Auditor General, the Inspector General, and the Budget Monitoring Unit.
            During a workshop in April 2010, government and DPs agreed to use the DTM to track
            corruption trends. The DTM will be managed by an independent research institute.

91.     Mainstream gender within CAS outcomes. The CAS addresses gender concerns identified
in the NDP, focusing on four areas: agriculture, girls' education, private sector, and reproductive
health, which are captured in the CAS Results Framework.


15
     The Bank's Country Team discussed GAC initiatives at a Governance Workshop in Kampala in December 2009.

                                         B. IDA Resources

92.      IDA resources under the FY11-15 CAS are estimated at about SDR1.3 billion (US$1.97
billion equivalent). The CAS covers the last year of IDA15 (FY11), the three years of IDA16
(FY12-14), and the first year of IDA 17 (FY15). Uganda's indicative IDA allocation in FY11 (before
front-or back-loading in FY09-10) is SDR 252 million (about US$385 million equivalent). Given an
expected slight back-loading of IDA resources in FY10, the available resource in FY11 is estimated
to be SDR256 million (US$390 million equivalent). An estimated average annual allocation of about
SDR 252 million (US$385 million equivalent) would also be available during each year in FY12-
FY15, assuming that the IDA 16 and 17 replenishments will provide as much IDA resources as the
IDA 15 replenishment. The estimates for FY11-15 are indicative only and can change depending on:
(i) total IDA resources available; (ii) the country's performance rating; (iii) the number of IDA
eligible countries; (iv) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA-eligible countries; and (v)
the terms of IDA's assistance to Uganda (grants or credits), which are determined annually and based
on the risk of debt distress. IDA allocations are made in SDRs based on performance, and the US$
equivalent is dependent upon the prevailing exchange rate. Uganda could also potentially access
IBRD for enclave projects, such as rehabilitation and expansion of the railway network.

93.     The government can increase its IDA allocation by improving its Country Performance
Rating, as measured by the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) and a
portfolio performance rating. Uganda performs better than average for IDA countries (and the
Africa region) on economic management (macroeconomic, fiscal, budget, and structural
management). However, Uganda performs average or below average on service delivery, public
sector management, efficiency of revenue mobilization, quality of public administration, and
transparency, accountability and corruption.

                    C. CAS Outcomes and the Proposed Program of Support

94.    To support the NDP, the CAS will focus on three strategic objectives, one cross-cutting
objective, and eleven outcomes. The relationship between CAS strategic objectives and outcomes is
shown in Figure 1.
CAS Instruments

95.     Analytical and advisory activities. AAA will include: core diagnostic economic and sector
work (ESW); ESW to underpin lending; and technical assistance (TA) and just-in-time policy notes
as requested. As done effectively under the UJAS, the Bank will use AAA to expose development
bottlenecks. The Bank will also use AAA to underpin its enhanced engagement on governance
issues. There will be increased emphasis on results-based AAA and on dissemination of ESW to
generate political debate and stimulate demand for more efficiency. In undertaking AAA, the Bank
will emphasize government ownership and donor partnership to ensure that findings are translated
into actions and results. A tentative AAA pipeline is shown in Table 2 and Annex 15). A CAS
Progress Report (FY13) will identify AAA for FY 2013-15.

96.     IDA-financed operations. To achieve CAS outcomes, the World Bank will finance
investment operations, adjustable program loans (APLs), development policy operations, regional
operations, and additional financing to scale up successful interventions. A tentative lending pipeline
is shown in Table 3 and Annex 16. IDA lending by CAS objective is shown in Annex 17. A CAS
Progress Report will define the IDA portfolio for FY 2013-15 based on an updated analysis of needs
and priorities.

97.     Budget support. Development policy operations are expected to account for about one third
of IDA financing under this CAS, as was the case under the UJAS.16 PRSC-8, which is planned for
early FY11, is the start of a new PRSC series within a Joint Budget Support Framework (see Box
7).17 The new series, PRSCs 8-11, will focus on improving efficiency and value for money in the
delivery of core public services, recognizing that strengthened accountability and efficiency of public
spending is critical for the effective utilization of future oil revenues. To this end, the PRSCs will
support (i) effective delivery of healthcare, education, water supply and sanitation, and road
construction and maintenance; and (ii) complementary reforms in procurement, budget planning and
execution, public sector management, public financial management, and decentralization. The
PRSCs will build on recent public expenditure reviews, which identified binding constraints to
service delivery.

98.     Trust Funds. Continuing the trend under the UJAS, trust funds are expected to grow in both
volume and strategic importance during the CAS period. Two recently-approved trust funds provide
cross-cutting support to NDP and CAS outcomes: a US$1.48 million grant for recipient-executed

  The volume and nature of budget support will be reassessed, as needed, during the CAS period within the JBSF.
17
  PRSC-8 was originally planned for Board delivery in late FY10, but has been shifted to FY11 due to delays in a
prior action involving amendments to the procurement law.

activities under the Governance Partnership Facility will be utilized to enhance the focus on
governance during the CAS period; and a US$12 million programmatic trust fund financed by the
United Kingdom's (UK's) Department for International Development (DFID) will support the
government's implementation of the NDP. A third, multi-donor trust fund, is being established to
undertake analytical activities related to the Joint Budget Support Framework (JBSF), thereby
informing the dialogue with the government and providing a platform for harmonized DP positions.
In addition, trust funds will provide cofinancing for Bank operations, such as the Northern Uganda
Social Action Fund II and the Transport Sector Development Project. Trust funds, such as Global
Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) and the Netherlands Trust Fund Africa Renewable
Energy Access Program, will also help pilot innovative approaches that can be scaled up under IDA-
financed operations. The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) will continue supporting sanitation
and improving service delivery to the poor in urban areas.

                                                            - 26 -
                           Box 7: A New Joint Budget Support Framework
 The government and development partners (DPs) approved, for the first time, a Joint Budget Support Framework
 (JBSF) in October 2009, to reduce the transaction costs of budget support for the government, increase the
 predictability of disbursements, and create a stronger and more consistent policy dialogue that fosters mutual
 accountability in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.
 JBSF partners. There are 12 JBSF partners, three multilateral DPs (the African Development Bank, European
 Commission, World Bank), and nine bilateral DPs (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the
 Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom). JBSF partners combined are expected to disburse over
 US$300 million per year, with the Bank accounting for about one third of the total.
 JBSF governance structure. It is two tiered:
  A DP Policy Committee meets regularly and engages with the government at an annual high-level forum;
  At the working level, the JBSF Technical and Policy Dialogue Taskforce meets frequently to coordinate the
   design and implementation of the JBSF and conduct an annual assessment of performance.
 A multi-donor trust fund managed by the Bank will be used to establish a Technical and Administrative Support
 Unit, to provide administrative support and generate high-quality technical and analytical work.
 Joint Assessment Framework (JAF). The JAF is developed and agreed by the government and JBSF DPs, and is
 used by DPs to assess the government's performance in agreed areas. The assessment of performance will form
 the basis for DPs' disbursement decisions. The JBSF also ensures timely disbursement by DPs.


       D. Strategic Objective One: Promote Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth

99.      The Bank will focus on four outcomes to promote inclusive and sustainable growth. To
improve conditions for the private sector, the Bank will support government efforts to improve land
registry, streamline regulations, and deepen the financial sector. The Bank will also help Uganda
maximize the benefits of regional integration, including by decreasing non-tariff barriers, such as
transit time through the northern corridor. Bank support will help farmers adopt new technologies to
increase yields and the share of production marketed, with outreach to female farmers to increase
their access to advisory services. To address the sustainability of growth, the Bank will support
improved land use management, reforestation, and promulgation of environmental regulations
relating to oil and gas policy.

CAS Outcome 1.1: Improved conditions for private sector growth

100. Analytical underpinnings. An Investment Climate Assessment (FY09) based on a 2006
survey pointed to lack of electricity and cost and unavailability of financing as key business
constraints. The Bank's "Making Finance Work for Uganda" (FY09) explored issues relating to
access to finance and development of term finance, highlighting the need for pension sector reform.
Under the CAS, the Bank's policy dialogue will support financial sector and pension system reforms
to improve access to financial services, and the preparation and implementation of a financial market
strategy. The Bank and IMF plan to undertake a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in
FY11 or FY12. A study on "Youth Transition to Work" (FY12) will use updated panel data and new
quantitative data to analyze constraints faced by youth in making the transition to work and identify
effective approaches to address these constraints, paying special attention to gender and post-conflict
issues.

101. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The ongoing Second Private Sector
Competitiveness Project (PSCP II, FY05) aims to improve enterprise growth (including outreach to
women entrepreneurs), business registration and licensing procedures, transparency and efficiency of
land registry (including lowering the time it takes to register property), and access to financial
services; and it supports the establishment of the Kampala Industrial Business Park. Under the
                                               - 27 -
CAS, additional financing (US$20 million, FY11) may be used to scale up the land registry
component; and a planned PSCP III (US$50 million, FY13) will finance activities to increase
tourism, youth employment, and exports of nontraditional commodities.

102. Expected results of regional operations. The Bank and the EAC Secretariat are discussing a
first and second EAC Financial Sector Regionalization Project (EAC FSRP I, FY11, covering the
first year; EAC FSRP II, FY12, covering years two through six) to establish a single market in
financial services among EAC members, following up on the signature of the EAC Common Market
Protocol in November 2009.

103. Expected results from trust funds. Trust funds will be used for targeted support linked to
project outcomes. A grant from the DFID Trust Fund for NDP Support will help the government
establish a new pension system regulatory framework, including a new Uganda Retirement Benefit
Authority. A grant from the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility is financing technical
support for the establishment of a PPP unit. The DFID Trust Fund may also be used to prepare a
detailed work program for the new PPP unit and build its capacity, and to develop a more focused
private sector competitiveness strategy and a system to monitor investment climate and doing
business indicators.

104. IFC. IFC has provided lines of credit and advisory services to commercial banks for on-
lending to SMEs, with a focus on expanding access to credit for women entrepreneurs, and has
undertaken an advisory program to develop mortgage lending. In support of PSCP II, IFC is
providing assistance on investment promotion and an investment climate reform program that covers
licensing, regulatory reform, business taxation, and other areas tracked in the Doing Business
indicators. IFC will assist viable investments in the Kampala Industrial and Business Park.

105. MIGA. During the CAS period, there will likely be opportunities for MIGA to support
foreign direct investment in the agribusiness, manufacturing, services, and energy sectors. Projects
will be supported on an as-needed basis. Given the typical size of transactions in these sectors,
MIGA would likely support some of these projects under its Small Investor Program (SIP). At
MIGA, SIP projects have individual (gross) exposures of less than US$10 million and are normally
approved in less than two months given their streamlined procedures.

106. Development partners. DPs coordinate their activities through a Private Sector
Development Working Group co-chaired by the Bank. DPs supporting private sector development
include: the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), DFID, the European
Commission (EC), the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), Ireland, Norway, and the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

CAS Outcome 1.2: Improved interconnectivity for regional integration

107. Analytical underpinnings. The Bank recently launched "Regional Integration, Trade and
Growth in the Great Lakes Region of Africa" (FY11), financed mainly by a grant from the Multi-
donor Trust Fund for Trade, to produce policy notes on measures to facilitate trade and increase
future growth.

108. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The ongoing East Africa Trade and
Transport Facilitation Project (FY06) finances the construction of one-stop border posts between
Uganda and Kenya and Uganda and Rwanda, which is expected to reduce the transit time through the
Northern Corridor from Mombasa to Kigali. The project also supports the concessioning of the
Mombasa to Kampala railway to a private operator and the preparation of a feasibility study to
                                               - 28 -
upgrade the Tororo­Pakwach line. The project will be restructured and may require additional
financing. The Bank and IFC plan to work jointly with the EAC and the African Development Bank
(AfDB) to help formulate regional regulatory and legal frameworks to facilitate sound railway
operations. When a comprehensive railway plan for the EAC is completed, the World Bank Group
could advise on prioritization and financing, including possible use of IBRD funds in addition to use
of IDA resources and other World Bank Group resources. A proposed East Africa Transport Links
(US$25 million for Uganda, FY12) will help improve Lake Victoria transit. Uganda is expected to
join the Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (RCIP) (FY12, US$70 million, of which
US$30 million from Uganda's IDA allocation), which will provide funding for ICT infrastructure
and various e-government activities to lower the cost of communications and improve transparency
and efficiency of government services.

109. IFC. The Rift Valley Railways (RVR) line from Kampala to Mombasa was privatized in
2006 with advisory assistance from IFC. Two 25-year concessions were signed by the Governments
of Kenya and Uganda and IFC subsequently provided loans to the concessionaire. However, owing
to ongoing problems with RVR management and performance, IFC loans were not fully disbursed.
IFC has worked to ensure the success of the concession, with the introduction of a new sponsor
group which will inject additional equity and bring onboard experienced rail operators as managers.
Once the restructuring is finalized, IFC will continue its financial support to the railways under the
existing project, with MIGA willing to consider guaranteeing the equity investment. In
telecommunications, IFC is supporting the East African Submarine Cable System to connect East
African countries to the rest of the world via high bandwidth fiber optic cable.

110. MIGA. As part of its commitment to Africa's regional integration agenda, MIGA may be
asked to provide guarantee support for the Kenya/Uganda railway, depending upon the pace of
ongoing commercial negotiations. IFC and the Bank are already supporting this project with loans
and guarantees, respectively, thus MIGA is working closely with both to ensure effective coverage.

111. Development partners. In the ICT sector, the Government of China is financing the
development of the national ICT backbone network, the first phase of which was completed in 2008
although it is still not fully operational. The second phase is under implementation.

CAS Outcome 1.3: Increased productivity and commercialization of agriculture

112. Analytical underpinnings. The Sustainable Land Management PER (FY08) and the
Agriculture PER (FY09) informed the Development Strategy and Investment Program (DSIP) of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry, and Fisheries. Following agreement on the DSIP,
government and DPs signed the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Program
(CAADP) compact in March 2010. The DSIP provides the strategic framework for the Bank's future
lending. During the CAS, the Inclusive Growth ESW (FY11) will identify constraints to agricultural
commercialization and inclusive agricultural growth. Once agricultural census results are available
(FY13), the Bank will undertake additional AAA to inform lending and the policy dialogue. TA on
water for agricultural production will be undertaken during the CAS period (FY13).

113. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The Agriculture Technology and
Agribusiness Advisory Services Project (ATAAS, US$120 million, FY10), building on the Second
Agricultural Research and Training Project, which closed in June 2009, and the National Agricultural
Advisory Service Project (NAADS), which closed in December 2009, will lead to increased
agricultural yields and shares of farm production marketed. The ongoing Northern Uganda Social
Action Fund II will complement ATAAS by helping IDP returnees and other vulnerable groups in
northern Uganda re-start agricultural activity and become eligible for advisory services. The Bank and
                                                - 29 -
government are discussing a new project (US$50 million, FY14) to address other priority areas for
public investment identified in the DSIP, which could include irrigation, animal health, pest control,
food safety, and quality assurance.

114. Expected results from trust funds. The ATAAS will be supplemented by a US$7.2 million
GEF grant to promote sustainable land management and help respond to climate change. In addition,
a DFID Trust Fund grant of about US$1 million will provide TA for DSIP implementation.

115. Regional integration. In FY10, Uganda joined the East Africa Agricultural Productivity
Project (US$30 million), which focuses on the regional aspects of agricultural research and
technology promotion, complementing the ATAAS.

116. IFC. The Bank and IFC will work together to identify actions to promote more rapid
commercialization of agriculture. Potential joint activities include: (i) input production (investments
in domestic/regional fertilizer production, support to seed companies and agro-input providers, PPPs
for provision of key inputs and services, and support to private sector investors on irrigation); (ii)
output marketing (support to outgrowers and PPPs for storage facilities); (iii) processing/value
addition (support for agri-business and expansion of PPPs in value chains); and (iv) exports
(investments in exporters and support related to infrastructure, trade finance, and logistics/handling
infrastructure).

117. Development partners. An Agriculture Sector Working Group plays a strong role in
coordinating support for the agriculture sector, aligned with the CAADP. Both the ATAAS and the
proposed Agriculture Sector Support Project are envisaged to be funded through a "basket fund"
using a SWAp approach with other active DPs in the sector. Three DPs will together provide about
US$41 million to the ATAAS basket: DANIDA (US$7 million), EC (EUR 15 million), and the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD, US$14 million). In addition, DANIDA and
USAID provide substantial off-budget support for commercializing agriculture.

118. Governance/value for money. GAC-related risks of ATAAS are high, given charges of
misuse of funds under NAADS. Consequently, the government and IDA have designed ATAAS to
strengthen management, enhance accountability, and minimize corruption risks. ATAAS includes a
Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plan. The Agriculture PER (FY09) included a value for
money analysis that also informed the design of ATAAS.

CAS Outcome 1.4: Increased efficiency and sustainability of natural resource management

119. Analytical underpinnings. Oil and gas: The Bank will prepare just-in-time policy notes
(FY11, FY12, FY13) on petroleum-related subjects and the experiences of other countries, which
could include: fiscal federalism; establishment of a petroleum training center; oil production in
environmentally sensitive areas; and development programs for local communities in oil-affected
areas. Water resources: The Bank and the government are preparing a Country Water Resources
Assistance Strategy (FY11) to identify entry points for Bank engagement in the water sector to
reduce existing water-related vulnerability of the economy and enhance the positive impact of water
on growth and poverty reduction. Follow-on TA during the CAS period will include support to the
government for advancing its Water Strategy and Investment Planning (FY13), and mainstreaming
climate resilience in water resources planning and management (FY14), building on earlier Bank
work on water and climate change. Environment: A study on environment and growth--as a stand-
alone ESW or to be included in the Inclusive Growth ESW (FY11)--will help identify
environmental and natural resource management priorities as a basis for informing a possible Bank
investment aimed at protecting and conserving natural resources including forestry.
                                                - 30 -
120. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The broad-based Environmental
Management and Capacity Building II (EMCBP II, FY01) helps establish the institutional and legal
framework for national and local-level environmental management. Additional financing (FY09) is
supporting afforestation, improved municipal solid waste, and the establishment of environmental
standards for oil and gas exploration and production. The ongoing Sustainable Management of
Mineral Resources Project (SMMRP, FY04) and additional financing (FY09) strengthens
government capacity to manage the sector responsibly, supports artisanal and small-scale mining
communities, and lays the foundation for future investment through high tech geological mapping
and a modern transparent mining rights system. Based on the findings of the Country Water
Resources Assistance Strategy and the government's Water Resources Assessment and Strategy, the
Bank and government plan to prepare a Water Sector Development and Management Project
(US$130 million, FY13) to invest in strategic urban water supply and sanitation systems (see para.
140) and help the government operationalize water management zones. The Bank and the
government are discussing possible IDA support for the petroleum sector, which could include
support for towns and municipalities in the petroleum-affected area.

121.      Carbon-finance operations. Uganda has developed about a dozen Clean Development
Mechanism projects that bring global resources to mitigate climate change and support local
sustainable development priorities. Uganda was one of the pioneering countries to develop a project
with the Prototype Carbon Fund with the West Nile Electricity Project. Another carbon operation
involves the management and composting of waste in several small, growing cities across the
country. Uganda is also implementing a highly replicable community-based timber replanting
project. Carbon resources can also help projects that use biomass co-generation to generate heat and
electricity to supply the nation's electricity grid using renewable resources, such as bagasse
generation from sugar mills.

122. Regional integration. Given the transboundary nature of Uganda's water resources, there are
numerous regional activities under the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP)
and the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), in which Uganda has been involved for ten years. Work under
the second phase of LVEMP (US$27.5 million to Uganda) includes strengthening institutional
capacity for water and fisheries management, point source pollution control and prevention, and
watershed management in the Katoga river catchment.

123. Development partners. The Bank works with a number of sector working groups on various
natural resource management issues, including the Environment Sector Working Group and the
Water Sector Working Group. The Bank has proposed the establishment of a Petroleum Sector
Working Group to improve the flow of information and ensure harmonized DP support. Norway, the
lead DP in the petroleum sector, is implementing a three-year US$15 million program based on three
pillars: resource management, revenue management, and environmental management. The IMF is
also providing support on petroleum revenue management; and the AfDB is providing support on
infrastructure. The UN is currently developing a joint program on climate change.

124. Governance. The SMMRP is improving minerals sector governance by building institutional
capacity and implementing a new mining cadastre system. There is now revenue transparency at the
local level though publication of the share of royalty income to local governments. Revenue
transparency at the macro level has been agreed to in principle but Uganda has not yet embraced the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) process as a means to achieve this. EITI would
also provide a multi-stakeholder forum for more effective dialogue with civil society on both mining
and oil revenues and sector concerns.


                                               - 31 -
                                        Box 8: Climate Change in Uganda
Impact on Uganda: Uganda's exposure to climate change risk is moderate. Models by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change predict Uganda to get wetter and hotter. Climate change risks are associated mainly with
increased frequency and severity of floods and droughts, and associated natural disasters, such as landslides, erratic
rain and weather patterns, and spread of malaria to higher elevations due to increase in temperature.
The CAS will take a two-pronged approach to climate change: Consistent with the Africa Region Climate
Change Strategy, the CAS will support actions that make Uganda's economy more resilient to climate risks. Actions
will comprise: (i) mainstreaming of adaptation to climatic changes in sector operations in key productive sectors;
and (ii) targeted interventions for priority adaptation or mitigation issues (for example, in forestry or climate resilient
infrastructure in Kampala). In addition, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery is financing
regional technical assistance (Climate Observations and Regional Modeling in Support of Climate Risk
Management and Sustainable Development Country: Eastern Africa) to help countries, including Uganda, better
prepare in managing risks associated with climate change.
Adaptation: Adaptation will be mainstreamed through sector operations, including agriculture, transport, municipal
infrastructure, and water resource and watershed management.
Mitigation: Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions will target one of the most significant sources of greenhouse
gas emissions in Uganda--deforestation and forest degradation--and will be implemented through a forestry or
natural resource management operation and through support for renewable energy.
Coordination and technical assistance: An overwhelming number of donor initiatives on climate change and
limited capacity of sector ministries to respond to climate change require both strengthened donor coordination and
targeted technical assistance to the government. Both will be supported through the DFID Trust Fund for NDP
Support and draw on recent work by GTZ to map climate actors in Uganda. The DFID Trust Fund for NDP Support
and Country Environmental Analysis trust fund may also support studies on economic impacts of climate change
and environmental degradation on Uganda to inform targeting of the investment interventions. In addition, the
Uganda Water Resources Assistance Strategy will study climate change risks to water resources.


                       E. Strategic Objective Two: Enhance Public Infrastructure

125. The Bank will support Uganda's effort to address its most binding constraint to
growth--poor infrastructure. CAS interventions in the energy sector aim to reduce unmet demand
for electricity and increase the rural population's access to electricity, including through renewable
energy. The CAS program also aims to increase the percentage of national roads in good condition,
while rehabilitating key corridors that will help reintegrate northern Uganda and facilitate trade with
neighboring countries; and it aims to increase the rural population's access to all-season roads.
Expected results in the water sector include increasing the percentage of the population with access
to an improved water source, and the percentage of households with access to safe and effective
sanitation. The Bank will provide support to strengthen institutions and improve infrastructure and
services in cities and towns to facilitate spatial agglomeration needed for structural transformation.

CAS Outcome 2.1: Increased access to electricity

126. Analytical underpinnings. The government has pursued rural electrification in accordance
with the Rural Electrification Framework (2001-2010). The government will prepare a new Rural
Electrification Strategy (2011-2010) to accelerate access to electricity from the current low level. The
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and the Bank will collaborate on a diagnostic study
(possibly financed by the DFID Trust Fund for NDP Support) to inform the new Rural Electrification
Strategy.

127. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. There is substantial World Bank Group
support for energy, exceeding US$700 million including guarantees, which will continue under the
CAS. The 250 megawatt Bujagali hydropower station, supported by IFC, MIGA, and an IDA Partial
                                             - 32 -
Risk Guarantee (PRG), is expected to be commissioned in April 2012. The ongoing Energy for Rural
Transformation Program APL II (US$75 million IDA, US$8 million GEF, FY09), is part of a three-
phase APL to expand rural electricity access from the current less than 5 percent to 10 percent
(400,000 new connections) by 2015 in addition to supporting the development of at least 40
megawatts of renewable energy. The ongoing Power Sector Development Operation (US$300
million, FY07) is supporting short-term investments (emergency thermal generation and energy
efficiency activities) to overcome power generation shortfalls and financing gaps so as to stabilize
the sector in addition to sector policy changes needed to promote its sustained future expansion. An
ongoing component of the Privatization and Utility Sector Reform Project (US$5.5 million IDA
PRG, FY01) supports the concession of electricity distribution to Umeme.

128. The proposed Electricity Sector Development Project (US$90 million, FY11) will increase
electricity supply by financing improvements to the transmission grid system. Additional power
sector support (US$100 million) is programmed in FY12. The Energy for Rural Transformation
Program APL III (US$40 million, FY14) will focus on implementing the new Rural Electrification
Strategy to increase access to electricity and build necessary institutional capacity. Additional funds
for ERT III may be leveraged from other DPs to increase the program's scope. In addition, during the
CAS period, the government may request World Bank Group support for one of the major
hydropower projects identified as part of government long term sector strategy and cited as national
flagship projects in the NDP.

129. Expected results from trust funds. The Energy Sector Multidonor Assistance Program
(ESMAP) will support Uganda's efforts to identify geothermal resources and prepare feasibility
studies where possible. Under the Energy for Rural Transformation APL II, IDA and GPOBA funds
will be used for an OBA scheme to increase energy access to poor households in rural and peri-urban
areas. As part of the Netherlands Trust Fund for the Africa Renewable Energy Access Program, the
Biomass Energy Initiative for Africa will finance two pilot projects in Uganda, one involving
production of air-controlled top lit updraft stoves by local tinsmiths, and another to use fish waste to
produce electricity for a local community. Finally, a Russian Energy for Small and Medium
Enterprises Trust Fund is financing studies to assess barriers to private sector initiatives in the
development of renewable energy.

130. IFC. In addition to the ongoing support to the Bujagali project, IFC has provided a US$25
million loan to Umeme, the private electricity distribution company, to improve the quality of its
service and connect up to 20,000 new customers annually. The IFC loan contributes to Umeme's
US$50 million investment program for 2009 and 2010, which will enable Umeme to upgrade its
existing equipment and provide new electricity connections. The company currently supplies
power to over 300,000 customers.

131. MIGA. MIGA plans to continue supporting as needed its two guarantees in the energy
sector: the Bujagali project guarantee and a US$41 million political risk guarantee to Umeme. Given
MIGA's upstream involvement in the sector and contacts with the energy investor community, it is
likely that MIGA will be asked during the CAS period to provide additional cover for the Umeme
project as well as cover for new power generation projects. MIGA is, in principle, prepared to extend
additional guarantees, given the chronic power shortages in the country and the low rate of access to
electricity.

132. Regional integration. The emerging East Africa Power Market offers a long-term
opportunity for least cost power in eastern Africa. AfDB and JICA are financing electricity grid
interconnections between Uganda-Rwanda and Uganda-Kenya. A planned East Africa Power Pool

                                                 - 33 -
Project will support the development of the newly established Power Pool and further strengthen the
backbone lines in Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and Rwanda. In addition, the Nile Basin Initiative trust
fund is financing feasibility studies for the Uganda-DRC and Uganda-Sudan transmission lines.
Subject to the feasibility study recommendations, the regional program may support construction of
the Uganda-DRC line.

133. Development partners. The key players in the sector include: the Norwegian Agency for
Development Cooperation (NORAD), the German Reconstruction Credit Institute (KfW), Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and AfDB ­ and have provided financing towards
generation, transmission network development in addition to rural electrification and technical
assistance and capacity building activities. To enhance the cooperation among the development
partners and joint support to the sector, the Bank under the ongoing Power Sector Development
Operation is supporting the set up and operation of the Energy Sector Working Group led by the
Ministry of Energy and Minerals Development. The major objectives of the Sector Working Group
are to: align the work within the energy and mineral development sector more closely with national
priorities, and strengthen the cross-sectoral links between sector activities and other sectors by
adopting a participatory and inclusive planning process.

134. Governance/value for money. The sector faces challenges arising out of the sector's
unbundling with increased private sector participation and relatively young institutions to plan,
oversee, and regulate sector activities. Specifically, there are capacity gaps related to preparation of
PPPs and negotiation and enforcement of Power Purchase and Concession Agreements. This has
tended to dilute the perceived benefits of the ongoing PPPs in the generation and distribution
activities. IDA, over the CAS period, will support development of the requisite framework and
capacity in the areas of PPPs and project finance so as to leverage the available public financing and
at same time ensure value for money.

CAS Outcome 2.2: Improved access to and quality of roads

135. Analytical underpinnings. A PER on Strengthening the Impact of the Roads Budget (FY10)
recommends ways to improve the allocation of rural road budgets, and makes detailed
recommendations in relation to national roads, including design, land take, procurement, and
monitoring and evaluation, to improve value for money and absorption capacity.

136. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The Government of Uganda has embarked
on an ambitious program to scale up road sector investment and IDA is strongly committed to
continuing its support. The ongoing Road Development APL III (US$107.6 million, FY05) is 94
percent disbursed and scheduled to close in FY11. Executive Directors approved the Transport
Sector Development Project (TSDP, US$190 million) in December 2009 to pave sections of national
roads to Southern Sudan (Gulu-Atiak) and north-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (Vurra-
Arua-Oraba), finalizing these corridors to neighboring countries and improving growth prospects in
post-conflict northern Uganda. The TSDP is part of a sector-wide approach that finances a three-year
(FY11-FY13) time slice of the government's National Transport Master Plan. Under the CAS,
additional financing to the TSDP (US$120 million, FY11) will finance the paving of Kamwenge-Fort
Portal in eastern Uganda, complementing work financed by the AfDB, and will improve roads and
drainage in Kampala. A second TSDP (US$160 million), planned for FY13 or FY14, will continue to
finance the National Transport Master Plan, including phase 1 of the Kampala Bus Rapid Transit.

137. Expected results from trust funds. Through the DfID Trust Fund for NDP Support, the
Bank will provide TA to the government on transport issues, including strengthening institutions and
increasing absorption capacity.
                                             - 34 -
138. Development partners. In 2009, government and development partners established the first
sector-wide approach (SWAp) for the road sector. As part of the SWAp, DANIDA, EC, and IDA
provide coordinated institutional support for the road sector. The government and sector
stakeholders hold annual Joint Transport Sector Review meetings and quarterly performance reviews
to review progress against targets

139. Governance/value for money. There is growing negative public perception of road sector
procurement and quality control. A GPF Window 2 grant financed a GAC diagnostic for the
transport sector and the development of a Governance and Anti-Corruption Action Plan (GAAP) for
the TSDP. A sector-wide GAAP for the transport sector is under preparation and will be a key
element of future Bank support.

CAS Outcome 2.3: Increased access to and quality of water and sanitation services

140. Analytical underpinnings. The Bank has had a long standing engagement in the water
supply and sanitation sector, supporting many of the key reforms that have led to the sector's
turnaround. A study on "Environmental Sanitation in Uganda: Addressing Institutional and Financial
Challenges" (FY10) highlights the need to integrate budgets for sanitation and hygiene; address
institutional bottlenecks that underlie sanitation and hygiene promotion; and remove institutional
constraints that hinder solid waste management and drainage services. In FY11, the Bank will
conduct a study of "Ten Years of Budget Support to Improve Rural Water Supplies and Sanitation in
Uganda."

141. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. Over the past decade, the Bank has mainly
supported rural water supply and sanitation through the PRSC and the Northern Uganda Social
Action Fund. A proposed integrated Water Sector Development and Management Project (US$130
million, FY13) will finance investments in water supply and sanitation in a number of priority towns
and cities, including several of the municipalities included in the Municipal Development Program
(FY12).

142. Expected results from trust funds. Two Output-Based Aid (OBA) water pilots will be
completed within the CAS period: one involving small local private operators in small towns and
rural growth centers, and the other involving expanding access to the urban poor through the
National Water and Sewerage Corporation. Results so far have been encouraging; and the
government and DPs are considering scaling-up OBA. During the CAS period, the WSP will provide
TA for a large-scale rural sanitation program addressing the enabling environment, local government
capacity building, and private sector participation. The WSP will continue to support the
implementation of large-scale sanitation programs in districts and helping to deliver sanitation and
improved water services to the poor in small towns.

143. IFC. Under the Small Scale Infrastructure Program in Water, IFC is providing advisory
assistance to the Ministry of Water and Environment and selected local governments to establish PPP
structures that encourage private water operators. The program is proceeding with a pilot in
Busembatia, has developed a generic PPP contract for replication in other towns, and has conducted
training for officials from 24 local governments. IFC is also working with Ugandan banks to
stimulate interest in commercial financing for the private operators, which would complement
concessional funding for a substantial portion of capital costs.

144. Regional integration. WBI has recently initiated steps to build a regional training hub in
Kampala, around the Water Academy established with NWSC support. The intention is to develop a
cadre of trained middle to senior managers in the region. Other related operations are the NBI and
                                               - 35 -
LVEMP (US$27.5 million to Uganda) which address water resources related issues, but include
some element of water supply investments.

145. Development partners. The Bank is engaged in the Water Sector Development Group. This
effort has largely been focused on ensuring the success of budget support mechanism including the
PRSC. The Bank is working with ten other DPs to develop the PRSC and budget support
mechanism. It is also working with the AfDB, KFW, EC and DFID to review options for support to
NWSCs highly urbanized towns. UNICEF has a water and sanitation component as part of its "Keep
Children and Mothers Alive" program.

146. Governance/value for money. WSP and the World Bank have supported a Water Integrity
Scan, which has led to an Action Plan on Good Governance; and the GPF Window 1 grant will
support its implementation. WBI is helping the government pilot community and citizen score cards
to promote better governance.

CAS Outcome 2.4: Improved management and delivery of urban services

147. Analytical underpinnings. Cities Alliance is supporting the development of a national urban
policy and strategic urban development plan, which will provide a framework for interventions in the
urban sector.

148. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The Bank is committed to long-term support
for Kampala, secondary cities, and local governments through APLs. The ongoing Kampala
Institutional and Infrastructure Development Project APL I (KIIDP, FY08) will improve urban
planning and management in Kampala. The Transport Sector Development Project (TSDP, FY10)
finances detailed designs for a Bus Rapid Transit in Kampala and provides support to establish a
Metropolitan Area Transport Authority. Additional financing to TSDP (US$130 million, FY12) will
provide further support for Kampala roads and drainage. A proposed Municipal Infrastructure Project
(US$150 million, FY12) aims to improve management and accountability of thirteen secondary cities
to enable urbanization and structural transformation.

149. Expected results from trust funds. A recently-approved Cities Alliance grant (US$4.2
million) for the government's "Strategy for Transforming Settlements of the Urban Poor in Uganda"
aims to help develop inclusive national urban development policies and strategies and begin
improving urban institutions and management in five municipalities, laying the foundation for the
proposed IDA-financed Municipal Infrastructure Project.

150. Development partners. The Bank is engaged in the Decentralization Sector Working Group,
which also includes Belgium, the EC, Ireland, the Netherlands, and UNDP. The UNDP has provided
US$250,000 to the government for urban sector baseline surveys, which will be used to formulate the
national urban policy and strategy. JICA is working with the government to improve urban roads and
traffic flow in Kampala.

151. Governance/value for money. The Bank has provided support for the development of a
good governance and anti-corruption strategy at the local government level; and its implementation is
supported by the Local Government Management and Service Delivery APL I. Under KIIDP, the
Bank has introduced citizen report cards as a tool for designing and monitoring investment projects
and to improve transparency and accountability to the citizens of Kampala.




                                               - 36 -
              F. Strategic Objective Three: Promote Human Capital Development

152. The CAS supports higher access to and quality of education and health care to improve
human development indicators and enable the transformation of the economy. In education,
expected results are increased percentages of students reaching literacy proficiency in government-
aided schools, and a higher average national gross enrollment rate for lower secondary education,
both with particular attention to girls' schooling, which is expected to lower the fertility rate and
maternal mortality. To decrease maternal mortality, expected health care results include a higher
percentage of deliveries taking place in government and private not-for-profit health centers and a
higher contraceptive prevalence rate.

CAS Outcome 3.1: Improved access to and quality of primary and post-primary education

153. Analytical underpinnings. The Bank's support is informed by the PER (2007), which
focused on education. The ongoing Universal Post-Primary Education and Training Program APL I
includes financing for analytical work to inform future policy and IDA support, such as double-shift
instruction and public-private partnerships in the provision of lower secondary education.

154. Expected results of IDA-financed operations. The ongoing Universal Post Primary
Education and Training Program (UPPET) APL I (US$150 million, FY09) supports expanded access
to lower secondary education, including reforms to improve quality, efficiency, management
capacity, and rationalize staffing. The UPPET also supports the preparation of a strategy for business,
technical, and vocational education and training. UPPET APL II (US$100 million, FY13) will
strengthen reforms to improve access to and quality of lower secondary education, leading to
increases in gross enrollment from 28 percent to 40 percent by 2012, will provide strategic support
for improving upper secondary education, and will help support the findings of the strategy for
business, technical, and vocational education and training. The ongoing Millennium Science
Initiative (US$30 million, FY07) supports high quality scientific research awarded through a
transparent and competitive process, technology-based innovation and its adoption by the private
sector, and an outreach program to support science education. The Bank could provide additional
financing if requested to continue support for annual research grants. The Bank is also supporting
education through multisectoral operations: the ongoing Local Government Management Support
Project and Northern Uganda Social Action Fund II provide demand-driven financing at the local
level to improve access to education, and the PRSC series focuses on improving public service
delivery at the local government level, including quality of primary education.

155. Expected results from trust funds. Through the Education Program Development Fund, the
Bank is supporting the government to refine and rationalize its Education Sector Strategic Plan and
prepare a proposal for submission to the Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund to help meet the
financing gap to achieve universal primary education.

156. Governance/value for money. The Education Sector PER and follow-up work, such as the
Human Resource Management Actionable Governance Indicators study, highlighted sector
governance challenges, including teacher absenteeism and difficulties in deploying teachers to rural
and remote areas. An education sector governance diagnostic will be carried out to ensure that
UPPET APL II addresses core governance issues.

157. Development partners: Uganda receives substantial support from DPs to improve access
and quality of primary education, among these: UNICEF, EC, Ireland, Netherlands, UNFPA, and
USAID. AfDB, Belgium, GTZ, JICA, and the Netherlands also support post-primary education,
including technical and vocational education.
                                                - 37 -
CAS Outcome 3.2: Strengthened health care delivery

158. Analytical underpinnings. The Bank's PER Fiscal Space for Health in Uganda (FY08)
recommends ways to increase spending efficiency, especially by improving human resource
management (health worker absenteeism is a major source of waste), strengthening procurement and
logistics management of medicines and medical supplies, and better programming development
assistance for health. The PER is informing the Bank's health policy dialogue and underpins the
lending program. During the CAS period, the Bank will help the Ministry of Health follow up the
issues identified in the PER, including through a policy paper on human resources for health and
policy notes on health financing.

159. Expected results from IDA-financed operations. The ongoing Local Government
Management Support Project and Northern Uganda Social Action Fund II provide demand-driven
financing at the local level to improve health care delivery, including by rehabilitating health centers.
The Uganda Health Systems Strengthening Project (US$130 million, FY10), which will be presented
to the Board together with this CAS, aims to strengthen national capacity to deliver essential health
services, with a particular focus on reproductive health, targeting activities which have been shown
to reduce maternal mortality and expanding access to family planning commodities and services. The
project includes US$30 million in Crisis Response Window resources to safeguard public spending
on reproductive health. The PRSC series and UPSPEP will complement the investment project by
addressing cross-cutting barriers to improved service delivery, such as lack of supply management
capacity, including procurement, poor human resources management and inadequate structures and
capacity for the management of health facilities.

160. Expected results from trust funds. The ongoing OBA Reproductive Health Program Pilot
in Western Uganda is expected to benefit 50,000 women by providing subsidized reproductive health
services and another 15,000 individuals through treatment for reduction in sexually transmitted
diseases. The Bank-administered trust fund, GPOBA (US$4.33 million) is working with KfW, which
is implementing the scheme and is providing co-financing of about US$3 million.

161. IFC. Under the IFC Health in Africa Initiative, Uganda is one of five countries identified for
a comprehensive policy assessment on the environment for private health care provision. This will
be complemented by a market assessment providing information for banks and other financial
institutions. Following completion of this advisory work, IFC also expects to identify investments in
the health sector, including PPPs, either for direct investment or indirect support through the two
equity funds IFC has established for health care investments in Africa, or lending from commercial
banks with IFC backing.

162. Regional integration. The Regional East Africa Public Health Laboratory Networking
Project (US$10 million for Uganda) will be presented to the Bank's Executive Directors in May
2010, together with this CAS. It aims to help participating countries--Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania,
and Uganda--prevent and control the spread of communicable diseases in East Africa by sharing
information, developing harmonized approaches, strengthening laboratories, and establishing a center
of excellence in each county to provide regional leadership in a thematic area. The IGAD Regional
HIV/AIDS Partnership Program (IRAPP) Support Project aims to increase preventive actions reduce
misperceptions of cross border and mobile populations, refugees and surrounding host communities
concerning HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation and to establish a common and sustainable regional
approach to supporting these populations in the IGAD states.

163. Development partners. DPs supporting the health sector coordinate their activities through
the Health Development Partners Group. Belgium, DANIDA, DFID, Italy, and the Swedish
                                        - 38 -
International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) support the health sector through general
and sector budget support. The US provides substantial support for health, especially through the
President's Emergency Program for Aids Relief and the President's Malaria Initiative. Global health
initiatives, including the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (US$300 million in
grants) and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (US$162 million over 5 years) provide
targeted support for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and immunization, although grants were suspended in 2005
over allegation of corruption. The suspensions have been lifted, but operations have not yet returned
to normal. The UN family has a number of interventions under Outcome 3 of the UN Development
Assistance Framework.

164. Governance. As part of the preparation of the Health Systems and Strengthening Project, the
Ministry of Health developed and adopted a governance strategy and action plan, which emphasizes
actions to strengthen health sector management functions and accountability and transparency in
service delivery. The project has a strong emphasis on improving human resource and budget
management, which are among the core challenges to effective service delivery. The project will
support aspects related to strengthening logistics management for drugs, which should lead to
improved drug availability and reduced wastage.

             G. Strategic Objective Four: Good Governance and Value for Money

165. Strengthening value for money is critical for high-quality infrastructure investments
and service delivery, and thus for structural transformation. It is especially important in the
context of future oil wealth. Under the CAS, the Bank aims to strengthen accountability and improve
public financial management (PFM), public procurement, and public sector management at both
local and national levels.

CAS Outcome 4.1: Strengthened accountability and efficiency of public financial and human
resource management

166. Analytical underpinnings. A study "PFM Reform in Uganda--A Platform Approach"
(FY09) and a Public Financial Management Performance Report (PEFA Report, FY09) inform the
PFM reform agenda. PFM and procurement reform are supported by the Financial Management and
Accountability Program (FINMAP), a US$60 million basket fund financed by the government and
six DPs. The Bank is leading a restructuring of FINMAP to better focus on service delivery. During
the CAS period, FINMAP is expected to support the roll out of an integrated financial management
system (IFMIS); improve program-based budgeting with procurement planning integrated in the
budgeting process; strengthen accountability functions relating to internal audit, external audit,
procurement, and the oversight committees of parliament; and ensure that the PFM system supports
frontline service delivery. A pilot study on the use of Actionable Governance Indicators in human
resource management informs the design of public service reforms. Programmatic TA on governance
and anticorruption (FY11-15) will support key aspects of the public service reform agenda, focusing
particularly on ways of introducing and sustaining performance management, addressing equity in
service delivery, staffing of public service positions in rural areas, and tracking progress on public
service reform through a regular update of Actionable Governance Indicators on Human Resource
Management.

167. Expected results from IDA-financed operations. The Bank is supporting improved
governance and value for money at both the local and national levels. Since 2000, the Bank has
helped implement decentralization and build local government capacity and accountability to
citizens. The ongoing Local Government Management and Service Delivery APL I (LGMSD,
FY08), the Kampala Institutional and Infrastructure Development Project (FY08), and the Northern
                                               - 39 -
Uganda Social Action Fund II (FY09) support more effective local government management,
including mechanisms to empower communities to demand better services from their local
governments. The LGMSD APL I finances capacity building and the rollout of an IFMS to all
districts and municipal governments to increase transparency and efficiency in public financial
management and public procurement. A proposed second phase, LGMSD APL II (US$115 million,
FY13), will ensure local government capacity to sustain transparent and accountable service delivery.
The PRSC series (Pillar 2 ­ Good Governance) will provide complementary, cross-cutting support
for decentralization by supporting transparent and efficient PFM and procurement, such as increasing
the number of local governments publishing financial transfers and budgets from 53 percent to 90
percent by 2011. The ongoing Uganda Public Service Performance Enhancement Project (UPSPEP)
supports the establishment of more transparent and efficient public service management systems,
including an integrated payroll and personnel management system that will decrease ghost workers
from 15 percent to 5 percent by 2013. The PRSC 8 (US$120 million, FY11) supports the adoption by
2011 of a public service pay system based on performance principles, increasing compliance with
procurement audit recommendations and increasing the number of contracts with records that comply
with public procurement regulations from 32 percent to 70 percent. The PRSC also supports piloting
a procurement indicator framework to track compliance with the procurement law in 15 ministries or
agencies, with further roll out expected under future operations. These indicators will inform the
design of future public procurement reforms.

168. Expected results from trust funds. A Governance Partnership Facility Window 1 grant
(US$1.48 million) will help reposition the Bank's role on governance during the CAS period, by
financing further work on the Data Tracking Mechanism, political economy and GAC diagnostics in
various sectors, engagement with external stakeholders in implementing the GAAPs developed under
the GPF Window 2 grant, and peer learning sessions for Bank staff.

169. Development partners. DPs are developing a common approach to addressing GAC issues,
based on the OECD/DAC principles on constructive and collaborative engagement with government
counterparts, in the context of the Accountability Sector Working Group, co-led by DFID and the
World Bank. DFID is funding a capacity building program to strengthen accountability sector
institutions (including an emphasis on demand side accountability) and the EC is financing civil
society capacity building to enhance demand for good governance, particularly in relation to service
delivery. The Bank's agreed role is to manage a participatory process to develop the Data Tracking
Mechanism, an anti-corruption monitoring tool, to improve governance arrangements in investment
projects and to think through the re-positioning process related to the reduced reliance of government
on budget support.

                                H. Strengthening Aid Effectiveness

170. During the CAS period, the Bank will continue to promote donor harmonization and
aid effectiveness. The Bank is the permanent chair of the Local Development Partners' Group
(LDPG), which is the apex development partner forum in Uganda. The LDPG and its sector/thematic
groups provide a forum for development partner coordination and interfacing with the government.
In addition, the Bank is the permanent co-chair of the Joint Budget Support Framework.

171. Under the LDPG, there are around 15 sector/thematic development partner groups
(DPGs). The Bank chairs or co-chairs seven of the DPGs. The DPGs serve to form common
positions and provide the LDPG with technical analysis feeding into policy dialogue with the
government, and recent efforts have attempted to make the DPGs more results-focused. Each of the
DPGs is mirrored by a government-chaired sector working group (SWG) or equivalent, with
participation from the government, DPs, civil society, and other stakeholders. Most SWGs function
                                               - 40 -
as a practical forum for technical level discussions and elaboration of sector investment plans and
strategies, thus providing a basis for coordinated DP-government interventions.

172. The government will adopt a new Partnership Policy to provide a contractual
framework to advance the aid effectiveness agenda in Uganda. The NDP includes a section on
government-DP relations, outlining key issues related to aid effectiveness and stating the
government's intention to adopt a new Partnership Policy addressing alignment of aid with national
priorities and systems, transaction costs, coordination issues, predictability of aid flows, mutual
accountability for development results, and partnerships beyond aid. The Partnership Policy is
expected to play an important role for the management of aid over the medium term, as oil revenues
gradually reduce the government's reliance on external assistance.

173. The DPs undertake periodic division of labor exercises to encourage selectivity. The
2008 division of labor matrix is shown in Annex 18. Once the new Partnership Policy is adopted, it is
expected that DPs will undertake a new division of labor exercise under government leadership.
During the CAS period, the Bank will continue to encourage SWAps and joint supervision missions
where relevant.

                I. Implementing and Monitoring the Country Assistance Strategy

174. The Bank will begin using Uganda's financial management (FM) systems for
investment operations, in line with the Accra Agenda for Action and consistent with World
Bank financial management policy. The Bank undertook an assessment in April 2010 to identify
risks and mitigation measures. Uganda has already made a good start in the use of country FM
systems, as currently all Bank-financed investment projects are incorporated in the annual budget and
audited by the Office of the Auditor General. Under the CAS, use of country FM systems will be
considered for each investment lending operation, taking into account the project's nature and
complexity and supplementary assessments of implementing ministry capacity.

175. The Bank will maintain a decentralized and high-capacity Uganda Country Office. Out
of 11 operations (including the Bujagali Project and the Reintegration and Demobilization MDTF),
13 are supervised by Task Team Leaders based in the Country Office or neighboring country offices,
and this will increase to 17 by the end of FY10. The Bank office includes the Cluster Leader for
governance for Central and East Africa is based in Kampala and a local governance specialist. The
Bank will establish a satellite office in Gulu, intended to be shared with the UN family, to strengthen
on-the-ground supervision of programs in northern Uganda, deepen our dialogue with local
government officials and other stakeholders, and improve our understanding of issues affecting the
poorest part of the country. In total, the office currently comprises 81 staff and consultants.

176. The CAS Results Framework presents the results chain for the Bank's program of
support (see Annex 1). The framework uses Uganda's NDP as its starting point, and narrows down
the range of outcomes to those that the Bank can demonstrably influence over the CAS period. CAS
outcomes will be monitored jointly by the Bank and the government over the CAS period. Also, the
Bank will use the new Country Program Results Monitoring Tool to monitor portfolio impact and
progress towards CAS outcomes. Since most of the new operations foreseen in this CAS will likely
not finish implementation until after 2015, results during this CAS period will come mainly from
existing operations and the quicker-disbursing interventions included in the CAS.

177. The Bank will carry out annual results-based CPPRs, building on the matrix of actions
from the recent CPPR (see para. 78 and Annex 11).

                                                - 41 -
178. Trust funds are fully integrated in the CAS and will be managed accordingly. The Bank
has already taken measures to integrate trust fund programs and budgets with Bank-funded programs
and to ensure that trust funds are aligned with the CAS. Analytical work and policy notes funded by
trust funds undergo the same rigorous review as Bank budget-funded analytical work; and trust fund-
financed activities are implemented in accordance with the same fiduciary requirements as IDA-
financed operations. The Country Management Unit has established a trust fund management team
(including fiduciary and governance staff) to guide the use and management of the new
programmatic DFID and JBSF trust funds.

179. The Bank will prepare a CAS Progress Report in FY13, or earlier if needed, to evaluate
progress toward CAS outcomes and adjust strategy and program. The Progress Report will be
completed after Uganda's national elections in 2011, allowing consideration of new government
policy. By FY13, there will be a clearer picture of the oil sector, which is likely to impact the Bank's
strategy and program. Adjustments to projects under implementation will be reflected in revised
project results frameworks.

                                   V. RISKS AND MITIGATION

180. There are considerable risks for CAS implementation, especially in light of the March
2011 presidential and parliamentary elections and the recent discovery of oil. However, risks
would be even higher if Uganda does not move forcefully down the path of structural transformation
as required to increase growth, create employment for the growing labor force, and further reduce
poverty and inequality, and if Uganda does not build the transparent and accountable institutional
arrangements needed to manage future oil wealth.

181. Political risks are heightened by ethnic and regional divisions and by upcoming
elections. Since independence, ethnic and regional divisions have contributed to conflict and
influenced politics. While Uganda has made progress towards democracy, it has not yet established
an enduring political process through which all groups, regardless of region or ethnicity, have a
meaningful stake and can contest for power. In this context, governance and stability could
deteriorate in advance of presidential and parliamentary elections in 2011. Civil disturbances
resulting from clashes between the central government and the Buganda Kingdom in September 2009
have revealed some of the fractures in the political landscape.

182. There is a risk of policy reversals due to election pressures and when oil exploitation
begins. Frustration over the slow pace of structural transformation could lead some policy makers to
question pro-market policies and advocate for more state intervention. Also, as oil revenues come on
stream, reliance on donor assistance and their economic advice may decrease.

183. The "oil curse" represents the most substantial risk. The discovery of a valuable natural
resource in the context of poverty often increases the risk of conflict and poor governance. Even
when countries stay at peace, resource wealth typically leads to reduced growth, because resource
rents lead to increased patronage, negatively affecting governance and public investment. The more
ethnically diverse the society, the worse the performance of a resource-rich democracy, because
patronage is especially effective in ethnically diverse settings, and because oil can exacerbate
existing ethnic and regional cleavages. To avoid the "oil curse," Uganda must manage citizen
expectations and establish an institutional framework that ensures transparent and accountable
management of oil revenues for the benefit of all Ugandans.

184. Electoral pressures and oil wealth could exacerbate negative trends in governance.
Corruption, both high-level and small-scale, is increasingly pervasive, affecting infrastructure
investments; productive sectors, such as agriculture; and social services. A governance risk matrix
has been designed to map these risks as well as risk mitigation strategies (see Annex 6). The Bank
will conduct regular reviews of governance risks to adapt the CAS program as required, including the
balance between budget support and investment lending.

185. Growing numbers of poor, uneducated, urban youth could create further challenges.
With about half the population below the age of 15, Uganda has one of the youngest populations in
the world. According to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (2007) up to 58 percent of Uganda's
unemployed are youth with the greatest risk of unemployment being the educated youth entering the
labor market for the first time. An estimated 490,000 youths enter the labor market annually, yet the
formal sector (both public and private) creates only about 150,000 jobs each year. Unemployed youth
or underemployed youth tend to degenerate into "discouraged workers" who can easily be mobilized
for rebellion and social unrest. This was evident during the September 2009 riots, where the majority
of those arrested for participating were unemployed youth. The World Bank will work closely with
the Youth Unemployment Network to update the National Action Plan on youth unemployment for
Uganda.
                                                 - 43 -
186. As a landlocked country, Uganda is particularly affected by the security situation in
neighboring countries. For example, political strife in Kenya following the controversial election
disrupted Uganda's key trade route, underscoring the need to develop alternative trade routes.
Although the general situation in the region has improved, new or recurring conflicts are possible
during the CAS period. The run-up or aftermath of the independence referendum in Southern Sudan
in 2011 could affect the stability and security situation in Sudan and thereby regional trade and
remittances. Lack of political stability in Southern Sudan could also provide an avenue for the return
of LRA activities in northern Uganda. There is also the risk of refugees returning to Uganda into
areas that are currently recovering from a long period of insecurity. The development of resources
around Lake Albert could be a source of tension with neighboring DRC.

187. Other exogenous risks include weather and the associated impact on international
prices for agricultural goods. Weather conditions, such as droughts, have a strong influence on the
output of the agricultural sector and on the availability of hydroelectricity. Uganda is vulnerable to
other natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, landslides, and storms, which are likely to
increase as climate variability becomes more pronounced.

                                       Annex 6: Oil in Uganda

I. INTRODUCTION

1.      In recent years, there have been significant oil discoveries along the Albertine Rift in
western Uganda. Reserves of at least 800 million barrels have been confirmed to date, and the basin
is now believed to contain up to 2 billion barrels of oil. Even at conservative prices, oil revenue will
be considerable, potentially doubling government revenue within 6-10 years and constituting an
estimated 10-15 percent of GDP at peak production. However, oil price volatility will make revenue
and budget management a persistent challenge.

2.       Extensive exploration activities along Uganda's Albertine Rift started in 2003-04.
Currently, five of nine exploration areas are licensed to four companies. UK independent Tullow Oil
is at the most advanced stage of exploration and currently holds three blocks that comprise multiple
discoveries. Tullow is in the process of buying out its former partner Heritage Oil and is now seeking
to form a joint venture with one or more major international oil companies that can bring capital and
expertise to the projects as they move into the development phase.

3.      Tullow has estimated that it could produce between 150,000 and 200,000 barrels per
day over a 25-year production period. While timelines remain tentative, production is likely to be
phased and will be driven by the pace of infrastructure development. Limited production of 10,000-
20,000 barrels per day, primarily for domestic use, could start within two to three years, using
trucking and railroad transportation. Full scale production could be reached in five to seven years,
once downstream infrastructure is in place. Only at this stage would the government begin to realize
significant revenue from oil production.

4.      Oil production will require significant infrastructure development. Discussions about the
downstream processing and export of oil are ongoing. The government favors the construction of a
refinery in Uganda to serve the domestic and regional market. The oil companies are exploring a
number of export options, including the construction of a pipeline through Uganda and Kenya to
Mombasa and the possibility of exporting crude oil via rail and water through Kenya or Tanzania.
Tullow is estimating an investment of several billion dollars over the next five to ten years to develop
the requisite oil infrastructure. Regardless of the path chosen, large infrastructure programs could
generate employment and other economic opportunities but will also put pressure on government
regulatory and oversight systems.

5.       The Government of Uganda is receiving support from Norway under an Oil for
Development Program to improve the institutional framework for management of oil
resources. In 2008, Uganda adopted a new National Oil and Gas Policy that reflects best
international practices in all important respects and calls for the establishment of several new
institutions and structures. These include a Directorate of Petroleum to set and monitor policy; a
Petroleum Authority to regulate the sector; a national oil company to hold the country's direct
investment in oil projects; and a Petroleum Fund under the management of the Central Bank to
stabilize the revenue flow to the budget. Important legal amendments and developments will be
needed to implement the Oil and Gas Policy. Amendments to the Petroleum Act are being prepared,
and revisions to the revenue code related to the fiscal regime for oil are under preparation. A division
within the Ministry of Energy ­ the Petroleum Exploration and Production Department (PEPD) ­ has
been established to manage developments in the petroleum sector. While these developments are
welcome, it will also be vital to strengthen institutional capacity within respective ministries and
agencies to make the policy and legal framework operational.

                                                 - 60 -
6.     Uganda's oil resources are located in ecologically sensitive and valuable areas; several
of the exploration areas are within or border on national parks. The general framework for
management of Uganda's environmental resources is set out in the 1995 National Environment Act,
which created the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA). This act also sets out the
process by which companies are required to conduct Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs),
administered by NEMA. However, NEMA has little capacity to analyze EIAs and monitor the
implementation of environmental requirements.

7.      Oil prospects bring both opportunities and challenges. The economic impact of oil
production could be profound, with dramatic increases in foreign direct investment and domestic
revenue in the medium term and the possibility of reducing energy costs. But it may also bring
inflationary pressures, exchange rate appreciation, and new governance challenges. The so-called
"Dutch Disease" effect may impact the competitiveness of Uganda's agricultural exports, and it is
likely to make the country's growth strategy ­ with an emphasis on value added, export
diversification, and manufacturing ­ harder to achieve. This would threaten to increase, rather than
decrease, the income gap. However, the government has indicated its intention to earmark oil
revenue for strategic public investments, which could help to increase productivity in other sectors
and thereby offset the effects of Dutch Disease.

8.      Experience from around the world also suggests that natural resource discoveries
commonly decrease government transparency and accountability and increase corruption, as
the government becomes less dependent on the local tax base. While the 2008 National Oil and
Gas Policy promises transparency and strong accountability measures for oil revenue, the
government has not been very forthcoming to date with information about sector developments or the
terms of the production sharing agreements with oil companies. This has raised public concerns
about lack of transparency that are compounded by the government's expressed reluctance to sign on
to the EITI. The government also faces the difficult challenge of managing high public expectations
of immediate social benefits stemming from the country's oil riches. Public and political pressure,
especially in the run up to the 2011 election, could fuel rapid and unsystematic public spending.

9.       The government will also need to consider the impact of oil on other sensitive national
issues, such as land policy, fiscal decentralization, and regional cooperation. The debate about
land rights is becoming fiercer in the run up to petroleum production, and speculative land purchases
in the oil rich regions have already begun. The recently enacted Land Bill revealed significant
tensions between "indigenous" tribal claims to land and land rights for settlers or migrants. The
benefits sharing arrangement between central and local government is also a thorny issue that has yet
to be tackled publicly, and the government's recent pattern of subdividing districts, often along
ethnic lines, could intensify local political interests over national interests. The oil discoveries are
primarily in poor and conflict prone regions, and thus tension over access to the oil benefits, be they
revenue, jobs, or social benefits, threaten to fuel existing social fissures and local grievances. Local
politicians and traditional leaders in oil rich regions are already advocating for more resources to be
allocated to their respective communities. Furthermore, oil may impact external relations. The
Ugandan and Congolese Governments have yet to fully resolve disputes about the border through
Lake Albert, which caused a flare up in 2007.

II. PRODUCTION FORECASTS AND MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS

(i)   INDICATIVE PRODUCTION AND REVENUE FORECASTS

10.     Despite investor and government appetite for early revenue, full-scale production is
likely to be reached only in 2016 or later, once downstream infrastructure in place. Although
                                                 - 61 -
the pace of production ramp up will be governed by infrastructure (see Table 6.1), the duration of
plateau production will depend on the ultimate quantity of reserves. At the current estimate of 800
million barrels of reserves, plateau production could be sustained for 10 years or so before natural
field decline sets in. If the proved resource base expands to 1.2 billion barrels (not unreasonable
given the 2 billion barrel total basin potential cited by Tullow and others) peak production could be
maintained for 20 years or more. These two scenarios are presented for illustrative purposes in Figure
1. Given the level of uncertainty around timing and volume of oil production, the figures
should not be treated as revenue projections, but merely as illustrations of the possible fiscal
impact.

11.     Using the indicative baseline reserve scenario of 800 million barrels, government
revenue could double once peak production is reached and after investors recoup their costs.
Using the current fiscal regime and a Brent price assumption of US$75 per barrel through the
projection period, government oil revenue at peak production is estimated to gradually increase from
US$1.6 billion to US$2.4 billion per year (see Table 6.2) over the peak production period (2016-
2024). There is a lag between reaching peak production and peak revenue flows to Government of
one to two years due to investor recovery of capital and operating costs.

(ii) MANAGING REVENUE VOLATILITY

12.     Due to the volatility of oil prices, government oil revenue can be expected to vary
enormously from year to year even under the stable production scenarios described above.
Recent oil price experience confirms that prices can change by 50 percent or more from one year to
the next. Short term price shocks can result in even sharper movements. At US$40 per barrel
(roughly 50 percent lower than today's prices), Uganda's oil revenue would drop to US$800-900
million. If low prices were to occur during the startup period when investors are recovering their
costs, government revenue could be depressed even further to US$400 million or so. Conversely, if
prices increase to US$120 per barrel, government revenue could climb to well over US$4 billion per
year. The likelihood that annual oil revenue could vary to such a degree, even under a stable
production scenario, will present a persistent governance challenge for Uganda.

13.      There is a need to protect the budget from potentially large fluctuations in oil revenue.
If variations in revenue are allowed to spill into the fiscal operations, they are likely to adversely
affect economic management, as they will undermine the medium term fiscal framework and
frustrate investment planning. Windfall revenue may also fuel unsustainable recurrent expenditure. If
oil revenue is shared with local governments, they could also destabilize local government financing.
Regardless of the revenue sharing arrangements chosen, responsibility for stabilization of oil revenue
should be managed by the central government, as local governments' capacity to manage such
mechanisms is limited.

14.      Appropriate legal arrangements and stabilization mechanisms as well as prudent fiscal
management would help to shield fiscal operations against this variability. First, the legal and
regulatory framework for oil revenue needs to include appropriate stability clauses that include
capital recovery rules, income and withholding tax rates, royalty rates, and maximum rate in import
duties. Second, a stabilization mechanism would be required to fix the amount of resources allowed
to flow into the budget and the balance that can be saved/invested outside the government budget. In
the National Oil and Gas Policy, the government has indicated its intentions to establish a Petroleum
Fund to create a permanent source of wealth as a provision for intergenerational equity. However, the
types of fund and management modalities have yet to be articulated. There are two main types of
stabilization mechanisms: under a Stabilization Fund arrangement, a reference price for oil is
established, and only the revenue from oil production evaluated at that reference price is transferred
to the budget, while the rest is invested in the Fund. A Permanent Income Fund is used to invest oil
revenue and channels only the interest rate revenue from the accumulated assets to the budget. Once
the government has decided on the type of stabilization mechanism to use, it will need to select the
operational modalities. If it is to be a Stabilization Fund, the reference price above which revenue is
transferred into the budget will need to be specified. If it is to be a Permanent Income Fund,
management and investment options for this fund (domestic or external) will need to be specified.

15.     Fiscal prudence, as established over the past two decades, will help ensure that oil
revenue is used productively. Given Uganda's level of development, the demographic pressures of
a fast growing young population, and the public's anticipated gains from oil revenue, there will be
strong social pressures to increase public spending on infrastructure, education and health services,
and raise public service wages. Politicians will be hard pressed to show rapid dividends from the
country's oil wealth. The National Oil and Gas Policy emphasizes that oil revenue will be utilized not
for consumption but for capital investment and infrastructure development. An effective process is to
be established to evaluate investment proposals to be financed by the oil revenue based on forecast
rates of return. Strengthened institutional capacity, rigorous budgeting processes, and strict controls
will help safeguard these aims. Uganda may also want to consider the enactment of a Fiscal
Responsibility Law, as has been done in several other countries, to reduce the discretionary power of
using windfall revenue.

(iii)   DOWNSTREAM PRODUCTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE CHOICES

16.     Uganda's oil reserves vastly exceed the amount that could be consumed domestically, or
even regionally. Currently, Uganda consumes 13,000 barrels per day of petroleum products (fuel oil
and distillates), and this figure reaches approximately 24,000 barrels per day if it includes demand
from Rwanda, Burundi, and neighboring parts of eastern DRC. Regional demand is growing rapidly
and could reach 50,000 barrels per day in 10-15 years.

17.     Nevertheless, the government has declared its intent to refine all Ugandan crude within
Uganda. While improving Uganda's fuel supply security, a domestic refinery carries profound risk
for Uganda. A world class refinery in a landlocked country with undiversified crude supply
undoubtedly will face severe commercial challenges. Even a small-scale refinery tailored to
Uganda's domestic fuel needs will diminish the scale economies of export infrastructure without
necessarily reducing domestic fuel prices. There will be a temptation to embed hidden fuel subsidies
within a domestic refining entity. Reducing the price of crude oil feedstock to improve the
profitability of the refinery would reduce the value of the upstream oil production ventures where
large resource rents are set to be captured. However, the greater risk for Uganda is that protracted
debate over domestic refining strategy will delay important export infrastructure decisions.


                                                - 64 -
18.     Exporting oil would require the construction of a 1300 km export pipeline to an Indian
Ocean port. The most likely route would be through Kenya to Mombasa following the route of the
existing Kenya Pipeline, although port congestion in Mombasa is causing the oil companies to
consider other routes, some of which would pass through Tanzania instead of Kenya. Whatever route
is selected and whatever technology is used to assure flow (heating, dilution, or treatment), a
complex 1300 km pipeline would probably cost US$2-3 billion to construct and result in a
transportation tariff of US$ 8-10 per barrel. Forming the investment consortium for such a pipeline
and concluding the necessary commercial and financing agreements would be a complicated
undertaking. Access rules must be sorted out through policy and contract. Transit fees must be
established between Uganda and Kenya through what could be a difficult treaty negotiation. Using
the timeline of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline as a guide, these preconstruction activities could take
three years or more to complete. Assuming a further three years for construction, the earliest that an
export pipeline could enter service is 2016, and even this date carries substantial risk.

(iv)   THE IMPACT OF "DUTCH DISEASE"

19.    Among the other economic challenges, resource booms normally cause the currency to
appreciate as demand increases. This causes prices for non tradable goods to rise and reduces
productivity as factors shift to the non tradable sector and raise reallocation and transition costs,
which makes temporary specialization very costly. Such a phenomenon, normally referred to as a
`Dutch Disease', materializes due a mismatch between demand and supply. Prices rise with increased
demand only if supply does not expand to match the increased demand. Hence, the key point to
emphasize is that although the economy's capacity to absorb big oil revenue may have
macroeconomic implications, capacity constraints are essentially microeconomic "supply side"
phenomena.

20.     Concerns about the "Dutch Disease" in Uganda are not new, given the country's long
history as a large recipient of external funding. In fact, Uganda already possesses some of the
symptoms of Dutch Disease. There is a large and growing non tradeable, non agricultural sector, and
costs of non tradeables are high. Nonetheless, the real exchange rate remains substantially more
depreciated than in the mid-1990s despite a slight reversal from trend in recent years (and a slight
slowing of real merchandise export growth). Given the expected appreciation of the currency that
would come with sustained large foreign inflows from the oil, it will be important for the government
to focus on other factors that determine export competitiveness. Uganda's landlocked situation, high
transport costs, high fuel costs, and poor electricity supply, are important considerations in this
respect. It will therefore be important to use the oil revenue optimally to generate productivity gains
and growth. The government may also want to consider how and if the country's oil and gas
resources can help to increase availability and reduce the cost of energy. While it is advisable to
allow market forces to determine domestic pricing of petroleum products, it is nonetheless important
to promote a competitive market so that any fall in crude oil prices are passed on to the consumers.

III. INSTITUTIONAL           CAPACITY        FOR     EFFECTIVE        MANAGEMENT            OF    OIL
RESOURCES

(i)    LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

21.    Uganda's existing legal framework for petroleum sector governance is focused on
promotion and exploration activities and needs to be updated and expanded. Petroleum
exploration and production activities in Uganda are governed by the Petroleum (Exploration and
Production) Act, Chapter 150 of the Laws of Uganda 2000 (the "Petroleum Act"). This law permits
the award of petroleum licenses to private entities under certain conditions and gives the mandate for
                                                - 65 -
directing the upstream petroleum sector to the responsible Minister, currently the Minister of Energy
and Mineral Development. The Minister receives applications for any petroleum rights and is
responsible for issuing, renewing, and revoking petroleum exploration and production licenses. The
Petroleum Act also establishes the position of Commissioner for Petroleum Exploration and
Development, who is responsible for carrying out petroleum exploration promotion, initiating
petroleum legislation, and monitoring oil companies' compliance with existing laws, regulations, and
agreements. The Petroleum Act and corresponding regulations has served Uganda well during the
promotion, licensing, and exploration phase but needs to be updated substantially to handle the
development and production of oil and gas, appropriately capture recent trends and best practice in
the industry, and harmonize with a future revenue management law.

22.     The government's overall policy on oil and gas exploration and production is laid out in
the National Oil and Gas Policy for Uganda, adopted in 2008. This well crafted document reflects
international best practices in all important respects. It declares Government's intention "to use the
country's oil and gas resources to contribute to early achievement of poverty eradication and create
lasting value to society." It sets very high standards in the key areas of resource, revenue, and
environmental management. It promotes measures to defend the non-oil sector against the onset of
the "resource curse" and it commits Government to transparency and accountability in the
management of oil revenues. Consistent with best practice, the policy calls for the establishment of
three separate institutions to manage the sector: an oil and gas policy making and monitoring body
within the Ministry (Directorate of Petroleum), an independent regulatory agency (Petroleum
Authority of Uganda), and a separate commercial entity to hold Government's direct participation in
oil developments (the Uganda National Oil Company).

23.     While there is broad recognition within the government of the need to enact a revenue
management law, amend the Petroleum Act, update the regulations, and establish the new institutions
called for in the policy, none of the necessary legislation has yet been brought forward.

(ii)   TRANSPARENCY OF OIL SECTOR MANAGEMENT AND EITI

24.      Although the government has stated its intention to manage the country's oil resources
with full transparency, implementation of such transparency measures has been limited to
date. While not a sufficient precondition to ensure prudent resource management, transparency
measures make it easier for civil society and the media to scrutinize performance in the oil sector and
thereby hold the Government and private sector to account. Although the country's national oil and
gas policy calls for transparent resource management, Government has been reluctant to share
information regarding contracts, and the terms of the Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs) signed
have not been disclosed. Uganda has so far argued that this is not in the country's commercial
interest. The authorities have also expressed reluctance about joining EITI on the grounds that this
initiative signals that the country in question has weak/nontransparent revenue management systems.
While a case could be made for these arguments, Uganda's deteriorating governance and
international concerns about weak control of corruption should encourage Government do more
rather than less to demonstrate a commitment to transparency and thereby encourage confidence in
its oil management systems.

25.     While the discussion on transparency has so far focused mainly on the disclosure or
nondisclosure of PSAs, there are a number of other aspects of transparency in oil sector management
that equally need attention. Of particular importance in this regard are the modalities for marketing
the government's share of oil production, an issue closely related to the question of `refinery vs.
pipeline'. International experience shows that this is the aspect of oil sector management that is most
prone to fraud and abuse of public resources.
                                                 - 66 -
             a. Transparency in commercialization operations: national oil company vs.
                international operators

26.     Some of the greatest risks of opacity lie in the planned creation of a national oil company
to hold the state's direct interest in oil production projects and to market the state's share of oil
production. The experience of establishing and operating national oil firms in the African context
has shown that these firms are often non transparent, inefficient and an instrument for patronage.
While progress has been made in some countries in reforming national firms, experience shows that
once such institutions get off to a bad start, it becomes hard or even impossible to make corrections
along the way, as vested interests are notoriously difficult to dislodge. Success in some instances has
been achieved by forcing the national oil company to adopt a purely commercial role rather than that
of a de facto regulator. In Uganda the risks of mismanagement of marketing practices is exacerbated
by the plans to build a refinery. International practice shows that transactions between national oil
firms and state owned refineries are prone to price manipulation, often at the cost of the treasury and,
by extension, the population.

27.     Two alternative solutions can be proposed for addressing these risks. First, in case a
national oil firm is created and charged immediately with oil marketing functions, there is a
need to institute high levels of transparency in the operations of such structures from the start,
as well as adhering to high professional standards. Measures worth considering to safeguard
transparency include: i) having the accounts of the national oil firm or other structure charged with
oil marketing audited by audit firms of international reputation; ii) ensuring publication of the
findings of such audits, as well as of follow up actions taken by the structure; and iii) conducting
regular reviews of marketing procedures. A further set of actions should focus on the choice of
intermediaries in oil marketing. Setting criteria for choosing intermediaries and ensuring that national
oil marketing structures deal only with firms of international reputation is an effective mitigating
measure to prevent the kind of `insider trading' that is one of the largest sources of revenue loss to oil
producing countries.19 Lastly, the rapid development of training programs in the sector, as well as a
bursary system that could have locals rapidly trained in the principles of oil sector management,
would be essential to safeguard professional standards.

28.      Second, a transition period could be agreed during which oil marketing operations of
the state share of production would be contracted out to an international operator, under
disclosed terms. This would allow Government to build up the capacity of the national firm and
define transparent rules and procedures. The national firm would then take over the marketing tasks
after this transition period.

29.     Finally, in case a refinery option would be chosen, transparent and fully disclosed price
setting mechanisms for the transfer of part of the state share to the refinery would need to be
set.

             b. Transparency in revenue generation and management

30.   Transparency in the transfer of oil revenue from the marketing structure to
government, as well on any taxes paid by international operators, is a further essential element.



19
   Consisting of national oil trading structures trading with `front intermediaries,' which basically are owned by
related nationals, and thus lead to large revenue losses as oil is sold on unfavorable terms to maximize profits of the
intermediaries.
                                                        - 67 -
Apart from the creation of an EITI-like monitoring structure, the verification of oil sector revenue
and their effective transfer to the Treasury will contribute further to a transparency agenda.

31.     Government may consider internationally established "best practice" principles with
regard to public disclosure of oil revenue. Regardless of whether or not the Government chooses to
formally adhere to the EITI, it is advisable that EITI principles are respected in the way oil revenue is
managed, as EITI principles have become a minimum standard for good management of oil revenue.
Thus, it would be essential to institutionalize the following actions in a routine manner:

        Disclosure by private firms operating in the oil sector of taxes paid to Government, and verification of
        receipt by Treasury;
        Disclosure by the national structure in charge of oil marketing of revenue transferred to Treasury, and
        verification of receipt; and
        Creation of a multi stakeholder structure, including members of civil society, to monitor revenue
        flows.20

                c. Transparency in the use of revenue

32.     Finally, a commitment to enhanced transparency in the use of oil resources is
important, as experience shows that resources are squandered as often in the downstream process
(investment project choices and procurement) as in the revenue generation process. The section on
investment management (below) elaborates on this. In the context of oil, it will become even more
important to ensure that measures related to the transparent selection of projects according to sound
economic principles and transparent application of procurement rules are enforced.

(iii)     ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND GOVERNANCE

33.      Much of Uganda's exploitable oil is located in ecologically sensitive and biodiversity
rich areas, which poses a particular challenge for oil and gas exploration and development in
Uganda. The Albertine Graben is the most species rich eco region for vertebrates in Africa. The
principal threats to biodiversity in Uganda include habitat loss, modification, and alteration,
including specifically oil exploration and production. Another complicating factor is that much of the
oil is adjacent to or under the Albertine Lakes, which presents the threat of contamination of large
water bodies.

34.      The oil rich areas are also key ecotourism sites (for example, Murchison Falls National
Park) with high tourism potential. Oil exploration and production activities could have a variety of
negative impacts on the environment. They induce economic, social, and cultural changes through
alteration in land use patterns, migration, and socioeconomic and cultural systems. They also
increase liquid and gaseous waste streams, which may affect plant and animal communities due to
changes in their environment through variations in water, air, and soil/sediment quality and through
disturbance by noise, extraneous light, and changes in vegetation cover. These negative impacts need
to be mitigated and addressed to ensure ecosystem integrity.

35.    To minimize adverse impacts of oil exploitation on the environment, Uganda needs to
update and strengthen its environmental laws and regulations, strengthen institutional
capacity, and provide adequate resources to ensure enforcement. The environmental impacts of


20
   This would constitute a "minimum package" but does not cover the full EITI menu, which also includes
disclosure of PSAs.
                                                       - 68 -
oil and gas exploration and development are regulated through the National Environment Act, Cap.
153, and related laws and regulations that prohibit degradation of the natural environment and protect
biological diversity. Existing legislation, guidelines, and policies that enforce/provide for detailed
requirements for environment pollution control are, however, inadequate for petroleum operations,
and the existing legal framework (policies, laws and regulations) in other sectors needs to be updated,
as well. Furthermore, human capacity and technical infrastructure in government agencies
responsible for regulation are currently inadequate to handle upstream and downstream oil and gas
impacts on the environment and require further strengthening. In addition, there is inadequate
knowledge about the environment and possible environmental impacts of oil and gas exploration and
development activities.

(iv)   BUILDING DOMESTIC CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN THE OIL SECTOR

36.      Capacity building will be required to ensure that the oil sector has a transparent and
effective management system and delivers employment opportunities to Ugandan nationals.
Capacity is required in many forms, but crucial gaps include: negotiation capacity to ensure that
PSAs are negotiated in Government's favor; oil marketing capacity to ensure that state owned oil
resources are sold at the proper market value; oil revenue forecasting and links to budgeting; and
skills related to management of royalties from petroleum, oil and gas exploration and processing,
natural resource management, and civic engagement with communities.

37.     Government, through the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES), plans to establish
the Uganda Petroleum Institute as a constituent college of Busitema University for purposes of
building capacity through vocational training in oil and gas industry trades. Courses will be
given up to Crafts and Master levels (equivalent to Ugandan low and high level certificates) together
with ordinary diplomas. Curricula development is underway, and MoES has articulated the need to
support human resource development for faculty and infrastructure developments (laboratories,
equipment, and workshop installations). MoES vehicles for promoting these needs include the
Education Sector Consultative Committee and the Education Budget Working Group. Further, the
faculty of science at Makerere University introduced a bachelor's program in petroleum science in
the academic year 2008/09. Quality delivery requires regular interface with oil sites and collaborative
arrangements that provide staff with short term skills improvement programs. As part of the National
Oil and Gas policy, Government plans to conduct a comprehensive assessment of capacity needs for
all supporting institutions.

38.     The plan to create a Petroleum Institute is an important step in the right direction when
it comes to creating long term capacity. However, two complicating factors need to be addressed.
Retaining graduates of such an institute at public service wage levels will prove difficult. This poses
risks not only in terms of capacity gaps between the producing country and international operators,
but also inside the national institutional system, as non public service institutions will be able to
attract graduates while other institutions, such as the Ministry of Finance, may not. This puts
Government at risk of being unable to control its own operators. Furthermore, while setting up a
Petroleum Institute would address medium term expertise needs, it will not address critical short term
requirements. Therefore, the creation of the institute should be accompanied by development of a
limited bursary program (possibly supported by external partners) to deliver crash course type
training to a small core group of experts.

39.     Finally, it is important that capacity building is not just limited to government and
parastatals but also benefits the broader civil society. Stimulating the development of expertise in
civil society and oversight institutions is equally critical, and these institutions may not necessarily
benefit from the institute. Thus, creating funding opportunities for NGOs and think tanks to
                                                  - 69 -
strengthen their expertise on oil sector governance issues, for instance through a `development
market place' competitive mechanism of grant awards, would be an essential supplement to the
creation of a National Petroleum Institute.

IV. OIL REVENUE AND COMMUNITY ISSUES

(i)    OIL REVENUE AND INTER-GOVERNMENTAL FISCAL TRANSFERS

40.     The government has yet to announce if and how oil revenue will be shared with local
governments and how communities affected by oil production will be compensated. Experience
from other countries in Africa, most notably Nigeria, has shown that the importance of revenue
sharing arrangements between central and local governments and benefits that offset the adverse
effects of oil production on local communities. These play a key role in ensuring social cohesion and
a stable investment and production environment. Furthermore, pressures may arise across the country
for increased budget allocations to local governments to satisfy high public expectations of benefits
from oil production.

41.     Uganda's policy of decentralization is embedded in the Constitution and is one of the
major policy reforms adopted by government in the 1990s. The policy transferred a number of
service delivery mandates from the central to local governments. Today, basic services such as
primary education; primary health care; water and sanitation; district, urban, community, and access
roads; and agriculture extension are being provided by LGs. Given the LG's weak revenue base and
the recent abolition of the graduated tax, which was one of the major revenue sources for rural LGs,
most service delivery mandates for LGs are being financed through transfers from central
government. Despite an increase in the service delivery responsibilities of local governments and the
creation of many new districts, the proportion of the budget allocated to local governments has been
decreasing in recent years, which is reducing the efficiency of expenditure in the social service
sectors. In anticipation of oil revenue, pressure is likely to mount on the central government to
increase the share of the budget allocated to local governments.

42.     Once the oil revenue comes on stream and more revenue becomes available to the
government, it will need to address comprehensively the current debate about LG financing
and propose a clear policy regarding intergovernmental fiscal transfers. Government is preparing to
undertake a study to determine a holistic strategy for LG financing that will cover LG's own source
revenue and fiscal transfers. This study offers an opportunity for Government to investigate the
impact of oil revenue on LG financing. Government also needs to address what direct benefit would
accrue to the districts and communities from which the oil is being extracted, over and above the
general resources being transferred to LGs through the IGFT. These transfers/benefits should be
provided in an equitable manner that will ensure the unity and cohesion (not tensions and
disintegration) of the country.

(ii)   OIL AND LAND POLICY

43.     To commence oil production, oil companies and the government will need to acquire
land for oil production facilities and infrastructure. This requires adequate institutional provisions
for land allocation, purchases and leasing arrangements. The Constitution of Uganda (1995) and the
Land Act, Cap 227, vests all land in Uganda in its citizens under four tenure systems: (i) freehold, (ii)
leasehold, (iii) mailo, and (iv) customary tenure. These systems provide the framework for protecting
the rights of the citizens and ensuring they are not deprived of personal property without
compensation. In essence, therefore, the legal framework exists for dealing with land matters in the
event of oil discovery in any part of Uganda, namely: (i) compensation of individuals or communities
                                                 - 70 -
in whose land oil is discovered, (ii) resettlement of individuals or communities in other areas to
ensure safety from the vagaries of oil extraction, and (iii) providing for sharing oil proceeds in the
short, medium, and long terms. However, following the discovery of large deposits of oil in the
Western part of the country, it has become evident that the details of all these arrangements remain to
be worked out. For example, there are no provisions for oil related matters in the ongoing
consultations and drafting of the land policy, and a national resettlement policy remains to be
developed. Furthermore, land policy in Uganda is a politically sensitive issue and bound up with
regional and ethnic identity and politics.

V. PUBLIC INVESTMENT PLANNING

44.      Resource rich countries have often fallen into a resource trap in which gross domestic
income rises fast, while non resource related domestic output stagnates (see Collier and Goderis
2008). Uganda's oil resources are a depletable resource, and consequently it is important for
sustainable development that the rents from resource extraction lead to income from other activities
as a means to overcome the resource trap. Therefore, the manner in which rents from oil are spent is
critically important. Public policy in general and public investment programs in particular need to
aim for the continuation of current non oil exports and facilitate the emergence of new export sectors
given that oil revenue is most likely not sufficiently abundant to provide a permanent income stream
(Page 2008).

45.     Resource and non resource rich countries are increasingly recognizing the importance
of public investment programs for building a more competitive and diversified economy. For
example, the new public investment management systems introduced by Chile and South Korea to
improve the efficiency of public investments have resulted in a more strategic selection of projects, a
higher degree of completion, greater transparency in the project cycle, and enhanced integration of
the capital and recurrent budgets.21 For the Government of Uganda to be able to prioritize public
investments, it is important to have in place an institutional rule based process, which requires proper
prior analysis of expected economic and social benefits of each public investment project.

46.      It will be important to assess how effective the existing Public Investment Management
system is in Uganda (see Box 1 on the various dimensions of public investment management
system) and to address its shortcoming before the oil revenue starts flowing into the Treasury
and the pressure to spend is there. Although some procedures are currently in place to guide the
preparation of investment projects, these are different across ministries, and capacity in ministries to
prepare, plan, and execute projects is weak. Not surprisingly, managing public investment is one of
the most challenging aspects of public finance, as these challenges span from planning, both at the
project and overall public investment budget level, to physical and financial execution of projects,
including procurement, monitoring, and evaluation of impact of investments. Integrating the use of
public private partnerships into the processes of selecting public investment projects is another
critical challenge. Government of Uganda has realized that its public investment management
system is in need of strengthening.

47.    It is expected that an assessment of the current public investment management system
will be undertaken this fiscal year and will lead to a comprehensive public investment
management action plan. The action plan is expected to be a mix of policy and process reform and

                             Annex 7: Youth Employment in Uganda

1.      In 2005/06, Uganda's labor force amounted to nearly 11 million people, of which 26 percent
were less than 25 years old. Close to 400,000 youth enter the labor force every year. They face
challenges in transitioning to stable employment that generates earnings high enough to meet their
aspirations. This challenge is expected to grow with the projected increase in the number of youth to
close to eight million by 2015. Major constraints to youth's transition to stable employment are:

    (i) Poor skills. In 2005/06, about half of the youth entering the labor market did not complete
        primary school. Opportunities in the non-farm sectors for those without complete primary
        education are very limited, especially for women. Vocational skill training for those with
        limited education is not widely available.

    (ii) Poor opportunities leading to underemployment. Many adults are in stable but low
         productivity employment; but, especially in rural areas, they report working less than 40
         hours a week, so they are underemployed. Nationally, 12 percent of the labor force is in this
         category, as is 20 percent of youth, especially youth in agricultural households.

    (iii) High expectations. Many of Africa's youth expect white-collar wage and salary jobs
          although most youth are not qualified and such jobs are scarce. Although Uganda grew at 12
          percent per annum between 2003 and 2006, private wage jobs accounted for just 10 percent
          of total employment in 2006. Few youth graduate from school ready to create a business in
          Uganda's rapidly growing informal sector; and most youth do not desire employment in
          agriculture, despite its commercial potential.

2.      Structural factors such as the education deficit, the pace of economic development and
demographic challenges (the labor force grows at 3 percent per annum), imply the problem of youth
absorption into the labor market will remain a challenge for the medium term. However, measures
can be taken to reduce the costs of youth transition to work. This requires both demand and supply
side interventions that help youth's transition to stable employment, taking cognizance of the
characteristics of Uganda's labor market in general and its youth in particular.

    (i) Develop and implement polices to improve employment opportunities throughout the
        economy and labor market in the wage sector. Uganda's NDP focuses on creating
        employment in small, medium, and large firms. Youth will benefit from these opportunities.
        The NDP also focuses on improving opportunities in agriculture through more capital and
        technology. If these initiatives are successfully implemented, youth with some education
        should be well-placed to take up the opportunities created in the agriculture sector and earn
        an adequate income.

    (ii) Encourage non-farm self employment. Self employment in the informal sector has
         enormous potential for the economy. This sector has been the source of many productive
         opportunities with ability to provide stable employment and solid earnings. The number of
         non-farm household enterprises grew at an average of 8.6 percent per annum between 1992
         and 2005. At this rate, approximately 25 percent of new jobs between 2015 and 2020 will be
         created in this sector. However, nearly 50 percent of household non-farm enterprises fail in
         their first three years. New entrants in this sector face high uncertainties and some may
         obtain lower income than they aspire. Strategies to increase opportunities and reduce risks


                                               - 73 -
             are needed in this sector as part of overall strategies for local economic development.
             Increasing access to low cost banking services plays a key role.

      (iii) Support youth in their transition to employment through programs that help youth
            identify opportunities and find support. Evaluation studies are ongoing for some projects in
            Uganda supported by the World Bank and non-state actors that have potential in this regard.

3.       The strategy for this CAS includes supply side interventions to address the skills
development and demand side interventions geared towards continued creation of private wage jobs,
entrepreneurship training, supporting household enterprises in the non-farm sector to increase their
incomes, increasing productivity in agriculture, public works and community programs that help
youth identify opportunities and find support. Some of the on-going projects and AAA that address
this issue and programs planned for the CAS are listed below.

4.      Analyze constraints faced by youth in making the transition to work and identify most
effective approaches to address these constraints.

                                   Annex 13: CAS Consultations

1.      The World Bank carried out CAS consultations with stakeholders in Kampala in
December 2009 and March 2010. The stakeholders emphasized a role for the Bank in addressing
the following challenges: commercialization of agriculture, infrastructure development, skills gaps,
population growth, youth unemployment, and governance and anti-corruption.

2.       Private sector representatives emphasized the difficult business environment due to high
power tariffs, lack of effective transport opportunities, corruption, and the lack of skilled labor.
Participants advised the Bank to focus on infrastructure, commercialization of agriculture, and
improved access to finance. On the knowledge agenda, the private sector would welcome research on
low-cost power generation, migration, and measures to improve vocational skills training and literacy
skills. Further, the private sector would welcome a tougher stance on governance and anti-corruption.

3.      Civil society organizations (CSOs) highlighted the following key issues: education and
technical skills, youth unemployment, urbanization and associated challenges, infrastructure
development and regional inequalities. Representatives would welcome a more prominent Bank role
in oil management, governance issues, support to commercialization of agriculture and land reform,
and access to energy for all. The Bank was also encouraged to provide more information about
projects, enhance its communication strategy, and involve CSOs as partners in promoting the value
for money agenda. Representatives recommended that the Bank should maintain focus on poverty
reduction and apply more conditionality in its dialogue with the government.

4.      Government representatives recommended that the Bank focus on transport infrastructure,
including railways, energy, and the commercialization of agriculture. The Bank was encouraged to
assist the government in addressing the demographic challenge, youth unemployment, and
reproductive health. Participants emphasized the importance of the value for money agenda to reduce
waste and corruption in service delivery, supporting vocational and technical skills training, tackling
rapid urbanization, supporting regional trade, and addressing gender inequalities. Some participants
were of the view that the Bank should be more selective and focus on infrastructure.

5.      Members of Parliament encouraged the Bank to provide support to commercialization of
agriculture, energy infrastructure, education including vocational training, addressing the
demographic challenge, and knowledge products in the area of employment. They recommended that
the Bank focus its lending on a few sectors. Finally, they highlighted the need to ensure equity
amongst project beneficiaries and encouraged support to Parliament to strengthen its oversight role.

6.      Development partners recommended a strengthened Bank role in the following areas:
financial services, commercialization of agriculture and land issues, population and employment
generation, good governance and public sector management, health and climate change. In addition,
they recommended that the Bank contribute to analytical work highlighting how DP interventions
contribute to alleviate bottlenecks towards achievement of the MDGs.

7.     Country team governance consultations recommended using projects as entry points to
enhance governance in sectors and piloting interventions on enhanced transparency and third party
monitoring. The country team emphasized the need to be modest in expectations given the political
economy challenges, upcoming elections, potential for government to be less responsive to advice
given prospects of oil, continued weaknesses in institutions, and limited citizen engagement.

E XECUTIVE  S UMMARY  
1.     The  CAS  Completion  Report  (CAS  CR)  covers  the  fouryear  FY200609  Uganda  Joint 
Assistance  Strategy  (UJAS).    The  UJAS  was  aligned  with  the  five  pillars  of  the  Government  of 
Uganda's  Poverty  Eradication  Action  Plan  (2004):  i.  economic  management;  ii.  enhancing 
production,  competitiveness  and  incomes;  iii.  security,  conflictresolution  and  disaster
management; iv. good governance; and v. human development.  
2.      Of  the  15  PEAP/UJAS  highlevel  strategic  objectives  included  in  the  CAS  results 
framework, three were achieved, eight were partially achieved, three were not achieved, and 
for  one  strategic  objective  it  was  not  possibly  to  assess  progress.    Bank  contributions  to  the 
achievement of the strategic objectives were rated satisfactory in four cases, moderately satisfactory 
in  another  four  cases,  moderately  unsatisfactory  in  six  cases,  and  unsatisfactory  in  one  case.  
Therefore,  Bank  contributions  to  achievement  of  strategic  objectives  included  in  the  CAS  is  rated 
moderately satisfactory.  
3.     While  Bank  interventions  were  generally  implemented  successfully,  they  did  not 
match  the  CAS  program,  which  covered  all  five  pillars  of  the  PEAP,  15  strategic  objectives,  40 
outcomes, and 56 outcome indicators.  In addition, the CAS results framework was never refined as 
intended,  thus  lacking  an  operational  framework  for  Bank  contributions  to  the  PEAP  outcomes.  
Consequently, the CAS suffered from lack of focus and from being overambitious. 
4.       The  Bank  delivered  a  larger  lending  program  with  fewer  projects  than  projected  in 
the  CAS.    Apart  from  minor  gaps  in  project  preparation  and  supervision,  the  quality  of  project 
implementation, outcomes and portfolio performance was generally satisfactory and cost effective. 
The Bank delivered more IDA support to the energy, education and social  protection sectors, and 
less  through  PRSCs  and  to  the  transport  sector  than  planned;  however,  this  in  part  reflected  the 
Bank's  flexibility  in  responding  to  changing  client  priorities.    While  portfolio  performance  was 
satisfactory,  there  is  still  room  for  improvement  in  addressing  quality  of  project  preparation, 
addressing effectiveness delay issues, and ensuring efficient project implementation.   
5.     The  Completion  Report  identifies  a  number  of  lessons  learned  to  be  taken  into 
account  when  formulating  the  next  Country  Assistance  Strategy  for  Uganda.    The  most 
important of these are the following: 
    i.   A joint strategy, elaborated with other development partners, is neither a necessary 
         nor  a  sufficient  condition  for  more  effective  aid.    Rather  than  spending  resources  on 
         elaborating  a  joint  strategy,  efforts  should  be  devoted  to  developing  an  operational 
         framework  for  alignment  with  the  national  development  strategy,  allowing  for  dynamic 
         changes, and for harmonization and coordination amongst development partners.  The Joint 
         Budget  Support  Framework  (JBSF),  and  the  GoU's  Aid  Policy  currently  under  formulation, 
         are examples of operational frameworks, although lack of government ownership may be a 
         challenge. 

                                                     90  
 
     ii.   Full  alignment  with  an  incomplete  and/or  irrelevant  national  development  strategy 
           should  be  avoided.    A  careful  assessment  of  the  completeness,  ownership,  and  strategic 
           relevance of Uganda's new National Development Plan should guide the formulation of the 
           next CAS for Uganda. 
    iii.   The impact of a CAS may be reduced in cases where there is no or limited selectivity.  
           The Bank should consider focusing its lending operations in a limited number of sectors. 
    iv.    Credible,  concise  and  realistic  results  frameworks  for  the  CAS  and  for  individual 
           projects are essential for planning, monitoring and budgeting purposes, including realistic 
           targets for PRSCs with their relative short lifecycle. 
     v.    Successful  reforms  depend  on  strong  sector  involvement  and  ownership.    Therefore, 
           reforms  supported  under  PRSCs  should  be  linked  to  sector  strategies  or  specific  sector 
           investment  operations.    A  corollary  to  this  insight  is  that  long  term  sector  reform  issues 
           should  not  be  addressed  exclusively  through  APLs  or  SILs.    In  addition,  government 
           leadership is a prerequisite for effective reform in any sector. 
    vi.    The  Bank  should  develop  a  countryfocused  set  of  actionable  governance  indicators 
           (e.g. compliance with rules and laws) for specific sectors to enable tracking of progress on 
           the governance and anticorruption (GAC) agenda in the next CAS. 
    vii.   Delays  to  effectiveness  of  lending  operations  have  affected  the  performance  of  the 
           Bank portfolio negatively throughout the CAS period.  These delays should be addressed 
           by  ensuring  early  involvement  of  relevant  stakeholders,  including  Parliament,  at  project 
           design and appraisal stages.  
6.    Box  1  below  summarizes  performance  of  the  Bank  and  the  Government  over  the  CAS 
implementation period. 
    Box 1: Bank and Government Performance during Uganda CAS Implementation, FY200609 
What did the Bank do well? 
  Quality and impact of analytical work: ESWs (CEM, PERs) had significant impact as evidenced in policy 
   priorities of GoU and in subsequent lending operations. 
  Supporting government reforms: sector dialogues led to reforms in some sectors (e.g. in roads, 
   education) but not in other sectors (e.g. health, agriculture). 
  Using PRSCs to address policy reforms with cross sectoral importance. 
  Post conflict development: the Bank played an important role in supporting GoU with post conflict 
   rehabilitation of northern Uganda. 
  Portfolio performance relatively good and disbursements higher than the Africa region average. 
What did the Bank not do well? 
  Limited results focus: the Bank elaborated a joint assistance strategy in the spirit of the Paris 
   Declaration.  But the CAS was of limited operational value because of a weak results framework.  For 
   example, indicators were often irrelevant to planned Bank interventions; targets were too ambitious; 
   data for indicators was not available or not observed frequently enough to measure progress; or change 
   in indicators could not be attributed to Bank interventions.   
  Limited selectivity: the Bank was engaged in almost all sectors of the PEAP.  Alignment with the 
   government strategy does not imply that the Bank needs to have an active lending portfolio in all areas. 
  Limited focus on the governance agenda: the Bank lacked a clear focus for interventions to address 
   governance challenges and did not make much progress on advancing public service reform, good 
   governance and accountability. 



                                                        91  
 
What did the Government do well? 
  Maintenance of stability and growth: the Government managed to maintain macroeconomic stability 
   and continuous growth with prudent fiscal policies.  
  Realignment of budget priorities towards infrastructure, in line with CEM and PER recommendations. 
  Suggesting and pursuing policy reforms in complex areas, including the roads and energy sectors. 
  Effectively achieved stability in northern Uganda. 
What did the Government not do well? 
  PEAP as planning tool: the Government did not use the third PEAP as the central framework for policy 
   making, budgeting, implementation and review in the CAS period. 
  Limited results focus: no clear results framework to measure progress of PEAP implementation. 
  Implementation challenges: lack of effective coordination and clear division of labor between main 
   actors (MoFPED, OPM, NPA) led to weak implementation of the PEAP. 
  Inequality: the Government did not adequately address inequality, as evidenced by poverty headcounts 
   in the north and northeast. 
  Effectiveness delays were a recurrent problem during the CAS period, mainly due to long parliamentary 
   approval processes and lack of sufficient consultations between the Bank, relevant government 
   institutions and Parliament. 


I.            I NTRODUCTION  
7.      This  Country  Assistance  Strategy  Completion  Report  (CAS  CR)  assesses  the 
effectiveness of the FY200609 Joint Assistance Strategy for the Republic of Uganda (Report 
No.  34310UG;  December  14,  2005),  henceforth  referred  to  as  the  UJAS  when  covering  the  entire 
Joint Assistance Strategy, or the CAS when referring to the Bankspecific part of the UJAS.1   
8.      The purpose of this report is to assess the overall performance of the UJAS and the Bank's 
contribution  to  development  results  in  Uganda,  and  to  present  a  set  of  lessons  for  future  Bank 
assistance to Uganda. 
9.       The Uganda CAS for FY200609 consists of a joint part (the UJAS) and a Bank Group 
specific assistance program.  This Completion Report considers achievements against both parts.  
At  the  time  of  drafting  the  Joint  Assistance  Strategy,  UJAS  partners  consisted  of  five  bilateral 
development  partners  (Germany,  the  Netherlands,  Norway,  Sweden,  and  the  UK),  the  African 
Development Bank, and the World Bank Group.  Subsequently, in 2006, another five development 
partners (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, the European Commission) signed up to the UJAS. 
10.     There was  no CAS  Progress Report (PR).  UJAS partners did not prepare a Joint CAS PR 
because of limited interest in reopening the UJAS to lengthy renegotiations.  Bank staff considered 
preparing a Bankspecific CAS PR in FY08 and early FY09, but decided against it on the basis that a 
new CAS would be prepared in FY09, leaving little time between the two documents.  However, the 
Government eventually delayed the preparation of the NDP by two years, thereby delaying the CAS. 
In hindsight, the Bank should have prepared a CAS PR regardless of the timing in order to sharpen 
the results framework and realign Bank interventions. 
                                                             
1 The main sources for the Completion Report are the following:  i. the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) Uganda 

Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE), 200107 (Report No. 49395, dated August 11, 2009); ii. the UJAS Review (report 
financed by the UK Department for International Development, DFID; final report dated January 20, 2009); iii. 
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) and Implementation Completion Reports (ICR); iv.  IEG reviews of ICRs; v. the draft 
Country Results Management Review (CRMR); vi. the Evaluation of the Implementation of the Paris Declaration in Uganda 
(Office of the Prime Minister, Uganda, May 2008); vii. the Independent Evaluation of Uganda's Poverty Eradication Action 
Plan (Oxford Policy Management, July 2008); and viii. inputs from the Uganda Country Team. 

                                                                 92  
 
11.      The PEAP, the UJAS, and the Bank specific assistance program had inadequate results 
frameworks.    The  UJAS  took  the  principle  of  strategy  alignment  with  the  national  planning 
framework too far.  Full alignment with (a subset of) an inadequate PEAP results framework meant 
that also the UJAS results framework was inadequate, as outlined in more detail in paragraphs 23
25  below.    With  an  unclear  results  framework  for  Bank  interventions  and  attributions,  the 
evaluation of performance in this Completion Report has had to deviate from simple comparisons 
of  status  with  targets  and  an  assessment  of  attribution,  as  baselines,  targets,  status  of  indicators, 
and planned interventions are often unclear from the CAS results framework. 
12.     The remainder of this report is organized as follows: 
              Part  II  outlines  Uganda's  long  term  development  objectives  and  the  alignment  of  the 
              UJAS/CAS with those objectives. 
              Part  III  reports  on  progress  towards  PEAP/UJAS  outcomes  and  assesses  to  which 
              extent progress can be attributed to Bank interventions. 
              Part IV assesses Bank portfolio performance over the CAS period. 
              Part  V  summarizes  lessons  learned  and  highlights  issues  that  should  be  addressed  in 
              the new CAS for Uganda.

13.     Three  successive  Poverty  Eradication  Action  Plans  (PEAPs,  Uganda's  Poverty  Reduction 
Strategy  Paper,  PRSP)  have  guided  the  Government  of  Uganda's  (GoU's)  policies  since  1997.    The 
first PEAP (PEAP97), predating the series of PRSPs, covered the period 19972000.  The revision 
in 2000, the PEAP00, covered the period 200003, while the third, PEAP04, initially covered the 
period FY200508, but was extended first to the end of FY09 and subsequently to the end of FY10. 
14.    The UJAS, as well as the Bank Group specific assistance  program, were both aligned 
with  the  five  pillars  of  the  PEAP04:  i.  economic  management;  ii.  enhancing  production, 
competitiveness  and  incomes;  iii.  security,  conflictresolution  and  disastermanagement;  iv.  good 
governance; and v. human development.   
15.      While the long term strategic goals for Uganda have not changed per se since the UJAS was 
prepared,  the  2004  PEAP  became  increasingly  irrelevant  in  the  political  landscape  since  the 
elections  in  2006.    The  three  successive  PEAPs  were  all  formulated  in  a  noparty  environment.  
Since  the  2006  multiparty  elections,  the  Government  has  increasingly  measured  its  own  success 
against  objectives  set  out  in  the  National  Resistance  Movement  (NRM)  manifesto  (launched  in 
January 2006) and against sector specific policies and plans.   
16.     In  retrospect,  the  PEAPs  and  the  UJAS  should  have  focused  more  on  productive 
sectors.    While  the  two  first  PEAPs  provided  adequate  frameworks  for  poverty  reduction  in  an 
economy  still  recovering  from  an  extended  period  of  civil  wars,  further  sustainable  reductions  in 
poverty  reduction  are  dependent  on  addressing  binding  constraints  in  the  economy.    This  was 
highlighted  in  the  Country  Economic  Memorandum  (2007)  as  well  as  in  the  PEAP  evaluation 
(2008).   
17.    The PEAP04 and the UJAS would have benefitted from earlier delivery of the Country 
Economic Memorandum.  The CEM was delivered in 2007, eleven years after the previous CEM for 
Uganda.    Thus,  the  Bank  missed  an  opportunity  to  provide  inputs  for  a  better  prioritized  PRSP.  
When  several  of  the  CEM  conclusions  began  to  be  reflected  in  the  national  budgets,  the  PEAP 
became increasingly irrelevant as the overall guiding framework for the budget. 


                                                       93  
 
18.      The  UJAS  was  one  of  the  first  joint  assistance  strategies  elaborated.    UJAS  partners 
deserve  credit  for  effectively  bringing  together  a  majority  of  the  most  important  development 
partners  in  Uganda  in  an  attempt  to  improve  aid  effectiveness  by  strengthening  harmonization 
between partners as well as alignment with the PEAP.  However, the UJAS was centered on three 
principles,  which  were  at  best  only  partially  realized.2    In  hindsight,  therefore,  the  UJAS  could  be 
said  to  be  premature.    For  example,  while  the  UJAS  outlined  joint  development  partner 
commitments and aspirations to work more effectively towards the achievement of the PEAP goals 
and objectives, the UJAS was not effective as an operational tool during implementation.  Further, 
the  extended  deliberation  period,  and  associated  transaction  costs,  meant  that  the  UJAS  was 
practically dated by the time it was published, by being fully aligned with a national development 
strategy which had lost its relevance.  The expected complications associated with a revision of the 
UJAS  meant  that  it  was  never  revised  in  light  of  the  changed  environment.    There  was  also  some 
disappointment on DP side that GoU showed limited interest in engaging with UJAS partners over 
UJAS implementation and other efforts towards improved aid effectiveness.  In practice, therefore, 
the  joint  strategy  had  limited  operational  importance  amongst  partners,  and--according  to  the 
UJAS review--appears not to have reduced transaction costs associated with aid on either GoU or 
development partner side. 
19.     The  UJAS  was  weak  in  its  analysis  of  political  economy  issues  and  in  outlining 
credible  responses  to  poor  governance.    The  joint  analysis  and  joint  risk  assessment  point  to 
rampant  corruption  and  state  that  "[t]he  Government  has  failed  to  successfully  prosecute  a  single 
highprofile  case  of  corruption...".    At  the  time  of  drafting,  UJAS  partners  were  well  aware  that 
increased political patronage could undermine the effective implementation of the PEAP.  Yet, the 
UJAS response amounts to little more than dialogue, capacity building, and strengthening of public 
financial  management  and  procurement  processes.    Elaborating  a  systematic  approach  to  dealing 
with governance risks within the Bank's mandate may also have been hampered by the decision to 
formulate a joint strategy with agencies having different mandates from the Bank. 
20.      The UJAS outlined joint financing scenarios (low case, base case, high case) intended to 
provide  a  coordinated  response  to,  for  example,  GoU  failure  to  improve  governance  and  public 
financial  management,  based  on  a  UJAS  assessment  framework.    The  assessment  framework, 
however, depended on the annual PEAP Review which never transpired as intended, partly because 
of  the  PEAP's  incomplete  results  framework.    Consequently,  the  joint  financing  scenarios  were 
never  implemented  as  intended,  as  demonstrated  by  three  UJAS  partners'  decisions  to  divert 
assistance away from budget support in response to the 2006 elections. 
21.     The Bank's lending program was generally relevant to Uganda's officially stated long 
term development objectives.  As would be anticipated, projects delivered towards the end of the 
CAS period were increasingly not foreseen at the time the CAS was drafted (see Figure 4 on page 
113).  More importantly, projects delivered deviated from planned projects, cf. Figure 1 and Figure 
2 below, where commitments are broken down by pillar and by sector board.3  Thus,  
     i.       PRSCs  were  reduced  from  $600m  to  $460m.    Combined  with  the  increase  in  the  overall 
              program  from  $1,000m  to  $1,287m,  PRSC's  share  of  overall  new  lending  in  the  period 
              declined from the planned 60 percent to 36 percent;  
                                                             
2 The three strategic principles for the UJAS are: i. a countryowned and countryled PEAP [in hindsight not the case]; ii. 

more effective collaboration among development partners [realized] and with the government [not realized as witnessed 
by GoU's limited appetite for engaging with UJAS partners]; iii. focus on results and outcomes [never realized given the 
inadequate and poorly monitored PEAP results framework]. 
3 The basecase lending program for the CAS included a number of projects with no allocations (see CAS Annex B3, p. 91).  

Therefore, some "new" operations, such as the NUSAF2 project, were in fact anticipated at the time of CAS formulation, 
only under another name and with no indicative allocation.  

                                                                 94  
 
     ii.       delivered  commitments  under  pillar  2  almost  doubled  to  $470m  compared  to  the  plan 
               ($260m),  mainly  due  to  the  new  $300m  Power  Sector  Development  project  and  delays  to 
               planned road projects; 
    iii.       NUSAF2  ($100m)  was  not  anticipated  and  explains  the  difference  between  planned  and 
               delivered projects under pillar 3/social protection; 
    iv.        delivered  commitments  under  pillar  4  were  reduced  as  the  Public  Service  Performance 
               Enhancement (UPSPEP) project was reduced from $70m to $23m; 
     v.        the nonplanned $150m PostPrimary Education and Training (UPPET) project explains the 
               significant increase in delivered commitments under pillar 5/education.

Note: Technically, PRSCs are under the Public Sector Governance Board.  However, due to the prominent role of PRSCs in the 
lending program in Uganda, PRSCs are presented as a separate category. 
           
22.      This  deviation  between  planned  and  delivered  commitments  could  be  interpreted  in 
different ways: with GoU priorities changing, the Bank was merely responding to client demands; 
the change in client demands was a response to a highly relevant nonlending program; or the 
deviation could be an indirect response to what was perceived as an increasingly inadequate CAS.    
While flexibility in the lending program may have been the secondbest response to an inadequate 
CAS, the absence of  a formal realignment  of the  CAS in response to  a CAS Progress Report meant 
that  interventions  delivered  in  the  latter  part  of  the  CAS  period  lacked  a  strategic  framework 
guiding interventions.  Having said that, all of the projects delivered were aligned with the strategic 
objectives included in the CAS. 

III.  P ROGRESS  A GAINST  CAS   O UTCOMES  
23.     The  assessment  in  this  section  focuses  on  progress  against  the  outcome  indicators 
and  intermediate  results  outlined  in  the  UJAS  (Appendix  1  of  the  CAS:  World  Bank  specific 
program).    The  PEAP  Results  and  Policy  Matrix  was  organized  around  the  five  pillars  mentioned 
above, 15 strategic objectives, 51 outcomes, and 76 outcome indicators.  The World Bank specific 
program of the UJAS was directly aligned with 15 of these strategic objectives, 40 of the outcomes, 




                                                                            95  
 
and  56  of  the  outcome  indicators.4    In  addition,  the  Bank  specific  program  included  a  number  of 
qualitative and quantitative intermediate results, which are a subset of policy actions in the PEAP 
Result and Policy matrix.  With these limitations in mind, Annex 1 provides a summary of progress 
against the 56 indicators included in the Bank specific program. 
24.     Assessing  progress  against  CAS  outcomes  posed  two  main  challenges:  i.  the  PEAP  results 
matrix  was  never  completed;  ii.  the  Bank  specific  program  did  not  provide  a  clear  link  between 
interventions and results.  Baselines and/or targets were missing for at least 31 indicators (41%) in 
the  PEAP.    Alignment  with  an  incomplete  framework  meant  that  also  the  CAS  results  matrix  was 
incomplete.  In addition, there was no clear link from Bank interventions and strategies/actions to 
anticipated  intermediate  results  and  progress  on  the  outcome  indicators.    Because  the  indicators 
chosen were those of the PEAP, attribution of Bank interventions could not always be assessed.5 
25.     The  Bank  specific  part  of  the  UJAS  recognized  the  lack  of  an  adequate  results  framework 
against which the contribution of Bank interventions to PEAP outcomes could be assessed.6  Yet, the 
UJAS  results  framework  was  never  refined  as  intended.    With  those  limitations  in  mind,  the 
following sections consider to which extent Bank interventions during implementation of the UJAS 
contributed to the outcomes as intended. 
26.     Bank contributions to the achievement of the strategic objectives were rated satisfactory in 
four cases, moderately satisfactory in another four cases, moderately unsatisfactory in six cases, and 
unsatisfactory  in  one  case.    Therefore,  Bank  contributions  to  achievement  of  strategic  objectives 
included  in  the  CAS  is  rated  moderately  satisfactory.    A  summary  of  CAS  outcomes  and  Bank 
contributions is provided in Box 2. 
                          Box 2: Highlights of CAS Outcomes and Bank Achievements by Pillar 
Pillar 1: Macroeconomic Stability Consistent with Rapid PrivateSector Led Growth: Satisfactory 
   Macroeconomic stability continued to improve during the CAS period, following the trends of the 
     preceding decade. Almost all targets were achieved. Growth rates remained high throughout the period, 
     the fiscal deficit was reduced beyond target, government revenues increased slightly, and credit to the 
     private sector increased. 
   Policy dialogue, mainly through the PRSC instruments, and robust recommendations from analytical 
     work successfully contributed to a prudent fiscal and overall sound macroeconomic policy framework. 
Pillar 2: Enhancing Production, Competitiveness, and Incomes: Moderately Satisfactory 
   Limited progress was made towards the outcome of increased private sector competitiveness, although 
     access to microfinance increased significantly.   
   The lack of a clear policy, strategic and institutional framework for the agriculture sector hampered 
     overall progress, despite the Bank's contributions to research and advisory services.  
   Road infrastructure improved and the Bank played a major role in establishing the Road Development 
     Fund, which is essential for sustainability of road sector investments.  Access to electricity more than 

                                                             
4 The results matrix for the Bank specific program of the UJAS has in some instances listed outcomes as strategic 

objectives rather than following the distinction between strategic objectives and outcomes in the PEAP results 
framework.  While the onetoone relationship between indicators in the PEAP and the UJAS is maintained, headings and 
groupings in Annex 1 differ slightly from Appendix 1 of the CAS. 
5 The targets that were specified in the PEAP were for FY08.  With full alignment of the results framework, UJAS targets 

were also for FY08, even though the UJAS covered FY200609.  Dates for status of indicators are provided in Annex 1.  In 
any case, it is the trend in indicators, rather than specific value in a single year, that matters for an assessment of progress 
towards targets as outlined in the PEAP/UJAS. 
6 UJAS, Part 2, paragraph 20: "In operationalizing the UJAS, the Bank in collaboration with the government and other 

development partners will further refine its results framework presented in appendix 1.  This framework will establish a 
more direct link between specific PEAP goals to government­led outcomes, and the contribution of Bank outputs to these 
outcomes." [Emphasis added]. 

                                                                 96  
 
                Box 2: Highlights of CAS Outcomes and Bank Achievements by Pillar 
     doubled, but still only 8% of Ugandan households have access to mains power.
     Management of natural resources did not improve.  Deforestation, depletion of fish stock and declining 
     soil fertility remain major challenges. 
Pillar 3: Security, ConflictResolution, and DisasterManagement: Satisfactory 
   The negative socioeconomic effects of the conflict in northern Uganda were reduced significantly due to 
     the cessation of Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) hostilities.  This is reflected in the reduced number of 
     casualties from conflict, the reduced number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), and the increase in 
     the number of former rebels and their collaborators resettled, having received amnesty. 
   Uganda has a strengthened policy framework to address conflicts and disputes as well as regional 
     disparities as reflected in the Peace Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP) and the Karamoja 
     Integrated Disarmament and Development Plan (KIDDP). 
   The Bank played a major role towards these achievements, mainly through interventions availing access 
     to improved social services for almost half the population of IDPs in northern Uganda. 
Pillar 4: Good Governance: Moderately Unsatisfactory 
   Uganda has not witnessed progress in terms of tackling corruption, improving public sector 
     management or improving the justice sector, with almost all indicators showing lower scores compared 
     with the baseline year.  Policy dialogue under the PRSC process as well as Bankfunded operations were 
     not able to provide significant momentum to the public service reform agenda, including good 
     governance and reduction of corruption.   
Pillar 5: Human Development: Moderately Satisfactory 
   In the education sector, indicators on enrollment and coverage show improvements, but major 
     challenges remain with respect to completion rates. 
   Uganda has seen some progress in fighting HIV/AIDS and malaria, increasing immunization rates and in 
     reducing infant mortality.  However, the health sector still faces significant challenges, as witnessed by 
     high maternal and child mortality rates.  
   Coverage and access to water and sanitation have increased, but at a slower speed compared to earlier 
     periods. 
       
27.     The  World  Bank's  Independent  Evaluation  Group  (IEG)  and  the  Operations  Evaluation 
Department  of  the  African  Development  Bank  produced  a  Joint  Country  Assistance  Evaluation 
(CAE) dated March 19, 2009, covering the period 2000 to 2007.  The CAE assessed Bank support to 
Uganda under the FY0103 World Bank Country Assistance Strategy and the first two years of the 
UJAS.  Main findings of the CAE are provided in Box 3. 
                   Box 3: Uganda Joint Country Assistance Evaluation, 20012007 
According to the CAE, the World Bank programs were effective in the areas of decentralization, public sector 
reform, growth and economic transformation, education, and water and sanitation. IEG found that more 
could have been done to help counter the perception of increasing corruption, improve power supply, reduce 
transport costs, enhance agricultural productivity, and help with family planning and reproductive health. 
The CAE rated the overall outcome of World Bank support moderately satisfactory. 
IEG Recommendations: 
     Support GoU in developing an analytical framework to guide governance reforms. 
     Encourage and support GoU efforts to develop mediumtolong term master plans for infrastructure. 
     Encourage GoU to coordinate ongoing monitoring and evaluation initiatives by its development 
     partners in order to secure reliable monitoring and evaluation of its overall poverty reduction strategy. 
     Reinforce the effectiveness of general budget support as an instrument for minimizing transaction costs 
     and facilitating the use of country systems.

28.    The remainder of Section III  assesses performance against CAS outcomes.  Normally, such 
an assessment would evaluate performance outcome by outcome.  However, with 40 outcomes and 
56 outcome indicators, such an approach would lose sight of the bigger picture.  The performance 
assessment is therefore organized around the five pillars and 15 strategic objectives, with reference 
made to specific outcomes and outcome indicators where this is relevant.  A complete overview of 
performance by outcome indicator is provided in Annex 1. 

PILLAR 1: ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT 

29.     Fiscal  consolidation,  macroeconomic  stability,  and  significant  debt  relief  helped  foster  an 
environment  conducive  to  a  growing  private  sector.    While  challenges  remain,  the  strategic 
objective was generally achieved.  The single strategic objective was highly relevant for the country 
and as a prerequisite for the success of other Bank interventions.

sector Led Growth 
     
30.      While it is difficult to attribute macrolevel effects to specific Bank interventions, it is fair to 
say that the Bank contributed positively and satisfactory to the relatively good performance under 
Pillar  1.    Policy  dialogue  in  connection  with  the  PRSC  series  entailed  agreement  with  GoU  on  the 
MTEF,  annual  budget  executions  were  closely  monitored,  and  Poverty  Action  Fund  (PAF) 
expenditures  consistently  exceeded  95  percent  of  appropriations  (although  public  administration 
expenditures  exceeded  the  budget).    Further,  PRSC  prior  actions  underpinned  public  financial 
management reforms, as further detailed in Box 4. 
                                    Box 4: The PRSC Series in Uganda 
The World Bank has been applying Poverty Reduction Support Credits in Uganda since 2001.  While the 
PRSC13 series mainly focused on poverty reduction through human development improvements, PRSC47 
increasingly focused on supporting the growth agenda as a means to reduce poverty.  PRSC47 thus focused 
more on macroeconomic management, public financial management reforms, reforms to improve the 
business environment for the private sector, and reforms for increased efficiency in service delivery. 
The PRSCs supported an expansion of service delivery and led to an increase in povertyreducing 
expenditures.  The expansion was largely propoor and equitable, but was offset by poor quality of service 
delivery, governance and human resource challenges, and limited impact on outcome indicators.  However, 
the PRSCs proved useful for addressing crosscutting issues, which explains the expansion of the PRSCs' 
policy action agenda. 
Despite the above achievements, providing assistance through PRSCs in Uganda also entailed a number of 
challenges.  For example, PRSCs did not facilitate governance reform, as the direct links between Bank 
support and outcomes were not clear, as evidenced in disconnects between short term prior actions and long 
term objectives.  Further, the PRSCs proved inadequate in dealing with specific health sector issues, for 
example addressing human resource management issues as an impediment to effective service delivery. 
Therefore, long term sector reforms are often better addressed simultaneously by development policy 
lending and a sector specific operation supported by the Bank or another development partner.  
 The use of a results matrix as a performance framework has tended to create contradictory incentives. The 
GoU sought to establish modest performance targets (especially with respect to governance), while the Bank 
would push for more ambitious targets.  This led to dialogue giving too much attention to the details of the 
assessment process rather than policy reform dialogue.  
Finally, PRSCs suffered from a lack of clear and measurable outcomes, and an often rather weak connection 
between policy actions and monitorable indicators in the PRSC matrices themselves. These challenges should 
be addressed under the new PRSC810 series.


                                                       98  
 
31.    As  outlined  in  Table  2,  progress  on  outcome  indicators  were  generally  met  save  for  a  few 
exceptions.  Targets were all realistic if not slightly unambitious in some instances. 
Table 2 ­ Progress on Outcome Indicators under Strategic Objective 1.1 
PEAP/UJAS Outcome Indicator                Baseline    Target                 Status  Year/Source 
                                         (2002/03)  (2007/08) 
Fiscal deficit (% of GDP)                      11.3%              8.2%          5.1%    FY08; IMF 
Revenues (% of GDP)                            12.0%            13.2%          12.8%    FY08; IMF 
Expenditures (% of GDP)                        23.9%            21.8%          17.9%    FY08; IMF 
CPI inflation                                   5.7%            < 5.0%          7.3%    FY08 average; BoU
Credit to private sector (% of GDP)             7.1%            10.4%          11.2%    FY08; IMF 
NPV of external debt (% of exports)           305.0%           238.0%          46.7%    2007; IMF/WB DSA
     
32.     While the fiscal deficit was reduced to 5.1 percent of GDP, this was largely a result of poor 
performance  related  to  government  expenditure  as  well  as  revenue  mobilization.    Government 
revenues reached only 12.8 percent of GDP, against the rather unambitious target of 13.2 percent of 
GDP  by  2007/08.    While  tax  administration  has  been  modernized,  low  revenue  mobilization 
remains  a  challenge.    The  largely  informal  local  business  sector  remains  outside  the  scope  of  tax 
collections and the majority of taxes collected are still trade related.  Government expenditures were 
reduced  beyond  target,  largely  as  a  result  of  limited  absorption  capacity  hampering  the  planned 
increase in development spending.  
33.      Although  core  CPI  inflation  reached  12.1  percent  by  end  June  2008,  and  the  average  for 
FY08 reached 7.3 percent, this was largely attributed to the domestic energy crisis exacerbated by 
high international commodity prices, and core CPI inflation had reduced to less than six percent by 
early  2010.    The  fiscal  stance  and  prudent  monetary  policy  kept  inflation  at  reasonable  levels 
without crowding out private sector finance.  Credit to the private sector increased to 11.2 percent 
of GDP against a target of 10.4 percent by the end of FY08.  The growth in private sector lending is 
attributed to prudent monetary and fiscal policies as well as increased competition in the financial 
sector.    External  debt  was  reduced  to  46.7  percent  of  exports,  easily  surpassing  the  target  of  238 
percent,  largely  due  to  debt  relief  under  the  HIPC  and  MDRI  initiatives.    Since  MDRI,  government 
borrowing has been underpinned by a Debt Strategy (2007) underscoring fiscal consolidation and 
limits new borrowing to concessional terms, except for infrastructure development.  
34.     Policy dialogue, mainly through the  PRSC instruments, and robust recommendations  from 
analytical  work  have  contributed  to  a  continued  prudent  fiscal  and  macroeconomic  policy 
framework  in  Uganda.    Focus  on  spending  on  public  administration,  efficiency  in  use  of  public 
resources highlighted by the PERs, and improving procedures for public procurement, to an extent 
helped  curtail  expansion  of  spending  in  nonproductive  areas.    Reorientation  of  the  budget 
towards addressing infrastructure constraints is attributed to the CEM and the PER on fiscal policy 
for growth.  According to the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (2006), Bank support to the URA 
Customs Modernization Program (under the East Africa Trade and Transportation Project) helped 
improve  efficiency,  reduced  the  scope  for  corruption,  and  eased  cargo  tracking,    exchange  of 
clearing  information,  and  revenue  collection.    The  Bank  contributed  to  increased  private  sector 
access to credit through the Second Private Sector Competitiveness project (PSCP2).  This project 
provided  technical  assistance,  training,  information  campaigns  and  support  to  business 
development services via support to the Private Sector Foundation Unit. 
35.    Progress on CAS outcomes under Pillar 1 are sustainable as witnessed by Uganda's ability to 
weather  the  impact  of  the  global  financial  crisis.    Future  progress  depends  on  Uganda's  ability  to

revenues from oil extraction poses an emerging challenge to macroeconomic stability. 

PILLAR 2: ENHANCING PRODUCTION, COMPETITIVENESS, AND INCOMES 

36.      Under Pillar 2 of the CAS, the Bank sought to contribute to seven strategic objectives and 14 
outcomes,  measured  by  20  outcome  indicators.    Several  indicators  are  missing  baselines  and/or 
observations making it futile to assess performance based on the outcome indicators only.  Rather, 
an assessment of progress towards each strategic objective, and the Bank's attribution, is provided 
in the following. 
37.     Most  of  the  PEAP/UJAS  strategic  objectives  were  not  achieved  or  only  partially  achieved.  
Despite  this,  Bank  interventions  had  a  positive  impact  towards  meeting  the  strategic  objectives, 
although links between interventions and  outcomes and strategic objectives are not always clear.  
Delays  to  effectiveness  and  implementation,  poor  followup  on  lessons  learned,  inadequate 
attention  to  institutional  weaknesses  and  trying  to  achieve  too  much  means  that  the  Bank 
contribution to the strategic objectives included in the Bank specific results matrix under Pillar 2 is 
rated moderately satisfactory.7

Strategic Objective 2.1: Increased and more Efficient Private Sector Production 
38.     Some progress was made towards increased private sector competitiveness.  Private sector 
investment  rose  only  marginally,  but  value  of  exports  exceed  even  its  FY14  target.    On  this  basis, 
strategic  objective  2.1  was  partially  achieved.    Bank  interventions  were  relatively  successful,  but 
suffered  from  delays  in  implementation  and  did  not  quite  match  the  ambitious  agenda  for  Bank 
contributions as set out under SO2.1.  For example, absolute performance against the Ease of Doing 
Business  indicators  improved  only  marginally,  while  relative  performance  gradually  deteriorated.  
On that basis, Bank contributions to SO2.1 are rated moderately satisfactory.  
39.     Bank  lending  operations  under  SO2.1  consist  of  a  Regional  Trade  Facilitation  Project  and 
the  Second  Private  Sector  Competitiveness  Project  (PSCP2).    The  former  successfully  set  up  the 
African  Trade  Insurance  Agency,  facilitating  international  trade  by  providing  insurance  against 
                                                             
7 Note that it is possible for the PEAP/UJAS strategic objective to not have been achieved, yet the Bank's contribution 
positive (MS or S), as long as the Bank's contributions match the ambitions set out in the CAS.  This apparent disconnect is 
a result of "overalignment" with the PEAP results matrix and does not necessarily reflect poor Bank performance in the 
individual operations.  

                                                           100  
 
political  risks.    The  latter  has,  among  other  things,  successfully  contributed  to  improved  GoU
private  sector  dialogue  via  the  Presidential  Investors'  Round  Table.    Other  achievements  include 
support to the establishment of the  land and company registries and the credit reference bureau.  
Financial deepening efforts were further supported by the IFC's mortgage support program.    
40.     Nonlending  activities  under  SO2.1  included  three  major  pieces:  Diagnostic  Trade 
Integration  Study  (DTIS),  Options  for  Strengthening  the  East  African  Community's  (EAC)  Trade 
Integration,  and  the  Investment  Climate  Assessment.    Common  to  these  studies  is  that  they  need 
closer review and followup actions to achieve an impact.  In addition to these analytic pieces, the 
Bank  provided  ontheground  advice  to  the  GoU  on  private  sector  related  issues.    Among  other 
things, the Bank served as a member on the steering committee for a revision of the GoU's Medium 
Term Competitiveness Strategy. 
Strategic Objective 2.2: Increased and more Efficient Agricultural Production 
41.     The agriculture sector grew at an average annual rate of just 1.1 percent from FY03FY08, 
significantly  lower  than  the  PEAP/UJAS  target  of  +3.8  percent.8    While  several  other  outcome 
indicators  with  respect  to  agricultural  output  and  land  titling  were  formulated,  these  indicators 
were not monitored and data are not readily available.  On this basis, SO2.2 was not achieved.   
42.     Bank  interventions  (the  National  Agricultural  Advisory  Services  Project  (NAADS),  the 
Second  Agricultural  Research  and  Training  Project  (ARTP2),  and  PRSC  support  to  the  Plan  for 
Modernization of Agriculture (PMA)), contributed towars policy reforms in the sector (fulfillment of 
prior actions for the PRSC credits), sustaining a liberal trade and pricing policy, availing investment 
resources,  and  provision  of  knowledge  and  advice.    In  particular,  Bank  interventions  provided 
support to the following intermediate results: i. establishment of the National Agricultural Research 
System (NARS); and ii. Expansion of the NAADS program to cover all subcounties.  Other aspects of 
the agriculture agenda were addressed by other development partners (e.g. agricultural marketing, 
livestock  services,  regulatory  services,  oilseeds  development,  rural  roads,  fisheries  etc.)    Thus, 
despite the strategic objective not being achieved, Bank interventions largely delivered what they 
set out to do.  Consequently, Bank contribution to SO2.2 is rated moderately satisfactory. 
43.     During the period, the Government pursued a liberal price and trade policy that supported 
the agriculture sector.  Domestic prices for agricultural and food products were in line with border 
prices adjusted to marketing costs.  In contrast to Kenya, where the state actively intervenes into 
grain  marketing  through  the  National  Cereal  and  Produce  Board  (NCPB),  and  to  Tanzania,  which 
bans  the  export  of  maize,  the  trade  policy  in  Uganda  remained  liberal,  with  the  Government 
pursuing outwardoriented policies through and beyond the EAC customs union.  
44.     A common weakness of the Bank's interventions in the agriculture sector has been the lack 
of a clear government policy framework regarding the roles of the public vs. the private sector and 
overlaps in various programs.  Initially, the PMA was the agreed framework for the PEAP.  Over the 
past couple of years, however, new initiatives for rural development have been introduced, namely 
the Rural Development Strategy (RDS) and Prosperity for All (PFA).  These programs have almost 
identical objectives and overlapping mandates.  In addition, recent government interference in the 
sector  may  be  motivated  by  political  patronage  considerations  rather  than  ensuring  the  strategic 
objective  is  met.    With  unclear  and  potentially  parallel  implementation  arrangements,  leading  to 
significant duplication of efforts and wastage of development resources, there is an urgent need for 
the  Government  to  clarify  its  policy  and  institutional  framework  to  facilitate  a  coordinated 
approach to meeting the strategic objective.  Recognizing the need for a clear policy framework, the 

                                                             
8 The growth rate of the agriculture sector over the period is disputed.  Whatever the correct growth rate is, it is likely to 

be unimpressive and below the target of more than 3.8 percent per annum. 

                                                                 101  
 
Bank,  together  with  other  development  partners,  is  currently  engaged  with  the  Government  to 
address these concerns in the Development Strategy and Investment Plan (DSIP) for 20092014. 
45.     Nonlending  activities  in  support  of  SO2.2  consisted  of  the  PER  on  Sustainable  Land 
Management and an Agriculture Sector PER.  The findings of this analytical work has already been 
feeding  into  the  preparation  of  the  next  phase  of  support  to  National  Agricultural  Research 
Organisation (NARO) and NAADS, preparation of a project with the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal 
Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) to support core public functions, and the finalization of the DSIP.  
46.       The major lessons to be learned for the next CAS are the following.  First, despite the critical 
role  in  supporting  technology  generation  and  dissemination,  it  is  critical  to  support  other  core 
mandates of MAAIF under the proposed DSIP, such as animal and plant disease control, regulatory 
services, water for agricultural production, sector statistics and monitoring and evaluation, etc. to 
support  agricultural  growth,  including  the  desired  impact  of  research  and  advisory  services.  
Second,  crosssectoral  support  is  required  to  enhance  lasting  agricultural  growth.    Better  rural 
roads,  greater  access  to  electricity  and  communication  infrastructure,  more  and  better  marketing 
infrastructure,  and  better  access  to  finance  in  rural  areas  are  urgently  needed  to  complement 
agriculturerelated policy and lending activities of the Bank.  Third, an increasingly important factor 
for agricultural development in Uganda is the recent surge in regional trade, notably with southern 
Sudan and Kenya.9  Agroprocessing is another critical area for future support, but its success will 
ultimately  depend  on  whether  concerted  efforts  on  supporting  rural  infrastructure  and  private 
sector  development  are  made  to  enhance  propoor  agricultural  growth.    Finally,  for  sustainable 
impact  in  the  agriculture  sector,  and  to  support  commercialization  of  agriculture  in  Uganda,  the 
articulation of a clear policy, strategic and institutional framework is a must. 
Strategic Objective 2.3: Increased and Sustainable Fisheries Production 
47.     The fishery sector showed rapid growth rates with the value of fish exports increasing from 
$88m in 2003 to $124m in 2008, after peaking at $146m in 2006.  While no indicator is assessing 
the objective of sustainable fisheries production, annual fish catch was 15% lower in 2007 than in 
2004.  This reflects the continued depletion of fish stocks as a result of overfishing and use of illegal 
fishing gears that end up catching immature fish, which in turn undermines the sustainability of the 
fishery sector and fish exports.  On that basis, SO2.3 is only partially achieved. 
48.     The PEAP/UJAS outcome indicators for SO2.3 were included in the Bank specific program, 
but the Bank has had neither lending nor nonlending operations supporting this objective over the 
CAS period.  The regional Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP) closed at the 
onset  of  the  CAS  and  the  followon  project,  LVEMP2,  will  only  become  effective  in  FY10.    This 
demonstrates  that  CAS  alignment  with  a  government's  development  plan  should  include  a  higher 
degree  of  selectivity  rather  than  uncritically  copying  objectives,  outcomes  and  indicators.  
Therefore,  under  this  strategic  objective,  the  CAS  was  neither  relevant  nor  realistic,  and  Bank 
contribution is rated unsatisfactory. 
Strategic Objective 2.4: Increased and more Efficient Production of Nonagricultural 
Goods and Services 
49.     The PEAP/UJAS outcome indicators chosen to monitor progress against SO2.4 were mostly 
inadequate.  Several baselines, target values, and statuses are missing, making it difficult to evaluate 
progress  towards  the  outcomes,  cf.    Annex  1.    That  said,  some  progress  was  observed.    Thus,  the 
number  of  tourists  visiting  Uganda  increased  by  65%  over  the  period  considered,  thus  exceeding 
the target by a wide margin.  Further, the contribution to GDP from mining and quarrying increased 
by 33 percent in real terms over the period consider.  On that basis, SO2.4 was partially achieved.  

                                                             
9 Uganda's official exports to Sudan increased elevenfold from $22.7m in 2004 to $245.9m in 2008. 



                                                                 102  
 
Bank interventions were fairly successful but suffered from slow implementation, partly as a result 
of poor stakeholder participation at project design stage (PSCP2).  Thus, the Bank's contribution is 
rated moderately unsatisfactory.  
50.      Bank  interventions  consisted  of  three  projects  carried  over  from  the  previous  CAS,  the 
PSCP2,  the  Protected  Areas  Management  and  Sustainable  Use  (PAMSU)  project,  and  the 
Sustainable  Management  of  Mineral  Resources  Project  (SMMRP).    There  were  no  nonlending 
activities  in  direct  support  of  SO2.4  and  no  new  lending  operations  were  approved  in  the  CAS 
period under review.   
51.      Achievements of the PSCP2 include the reduced time to register a property; reduced time 
to  register  a  business;  new  business  registrations;  and  support  to  MSMEs  under  the  Business 
Uganda Development Scheme (BUDS).  Other components are performing unsatisfactory, including 
the Kampala Industrial Business Park, and monitoring of project implementation suffers from poor 
availability  of  data  on  the  chosen  intermediate  outcome  indicators.    The  PAMSU  project  has 
suffered  significant  delays  in  implementation  but  is  showing  progress  towards  objectives.  
Development  outcomes  of  the  SMMRP  are  mostly  satisfactory  if  delayed  and  the  project  faces 
challenges over extension and additional financing, which was not yet approved by the end of FY09.  
Strategic Objective 2.5: Strengthened Infrastructure in Support of Increased 
Production of Goods and Services 
52.     Bank support to infrastructure over the CAS period was aligned with outcome indicators for 
road conditions, rural access to electricity, and freight carried by rail, cf. Annex 1.  Limited progress 
and  some  deterioration  was  registered,  although  the  indicator  for  roads  in  good  condition 
fluctuates  and  improved  in  the  latter  period.    Thus,  SO2.5  was  only  partially  achieved.    Bank 
interventions  in  the  infrastructure  sector  were  largely  successful,  but  delays  to  implementation, 
and timing and sequencing of interventions, could have been better.  Bank contribution to SO2.5 is 
thus rated moderately satisfactory. 
53.     Bank  interventions  in  the  roads  sector  consisted  of  three  phases  of  the  Road 
Development  Program  (RDP13)  amounting  to  $263m,  the  Road  Sector  and  Institutional  Support 
Project (RSISP), and the East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation Project (EATTFP).  The RDPs 
contributed to establish and/or upgrade a network of urban and rural roads, backed by analytical 
work on the transport sector strategy, on environmental policy, and on management and financing.  
Besides  improving  access  to  rural  and  economically  productive  areas,  the  RDPs  contributed  to  a 
reduction  in  average  travel  time  and  transport  and  vehicleoperating  costs.    Although 
implementation  of  the  RSISP  has  suffered  from  significant  delays,  the  project  has  largely  been 
successful.    Thus,  Uganda  National  Roads  Authority  was  established  and  operational  as  of  July  1, 
2008; the Road Fund Act was approved by Parliament in June 2008 and gazetted in October 2008; 
and the role of the Ministry of Works and Transport (MoWT) was redefined towards a regulatory 
and  planning  body.  The  EATTFP  contributed  to  the  establishment  of  the  EAC  Customs  Union  and 
reduced transit times for cargo traffic at border posts in the region. 
54.      Bank interventions contributed to improvements in the roads sector.  Despite this success, a 
number  of  important  lessons  have  been  learned,  notably  with  regards  to  the  Adaptable  Program 
Loan (APL): i. with the RDP phases being implemented in parallel, it was not possible to incorporate 
lessons  learned  from  one  phase  in  the  design  of  the  following;  ii.  intermediate  triggers  should  be 
defined  in  support  of  steps  needed  to  implement  the  reform  program;  iii.  establishment  of  new 
institutions  is  a  lengthy  process;  and  iv.  it  proved  difficult  to  agree  with  the  Government  on  a 
comprehensive  long  term  reform  program,  calling  into  question  the  appropriateness  of  the  APL 
modality in this sector. 



                                                      103  
 
55.      In  addition  to  the  lessons  learned,  future  Bank  interventions  in  the  roads  sector  should 
explicitly  seek  to  address  the  Government's  limited  absorptive  capacity  in  infrastructure 
investments and address the relatively high unit costs of road construction and rehabilitation. 
56.     The energy sector was the largest area of Bank interventions during the CAS period.  Three 
projects were carried over and are now closed or fully disbursed: the Power Project 4 (PP4), the 
Energy  for  Rural  Transformation  Project  (ERTP),  and  the  Privatization  and  Utility  Sector  Reform 
Project (PUSRP).10  The $300m Power Sector Development Project (PSDP) and the Bujagali Private 
Power Generation guarantee were delivered in FY07. 
57.     The  PEAP  recognized  that  energy  supply  is  critical  for  production,  competitiveness,  and 
incomes.    In  2002/03,  only  3%  of  Ugandan  households  in  rural  areas  and  8%  in  urban  areas  had 
access to grid electricity, while the rest relied on biomass and other renewable energy.  Uganda has 
large  energy  potential,  notably  hydroelectric  power  potential,  and  the  Bank  CAS  supported  the 
Government's strategy to develop new energy resources.  Accordingly, operations (PUSRP) focusing 
on improving the financial viability of the sector were implemented. 
58.     In  addition  to  financial  viability  of  the  sector,  there  was  a  strong  focus  on  expanding  the 
quantity  and  quality  of  power  (PP4,  PSDO,  Bujagali),  as  well  as  on  increasing  access  (ERTP).  
Strategically,  the  investments  served  to  bolster  Uganda's  private  sector  led  and  commercially 
oriented energy sector structure and supported both long term generation development (PP4 and 
Bujagali) and interim generation (PSDP).  The Bank collaborated closely with other members of the 
Bank  Group  (IFC,  MIGA)  and  other  development  partners.    The  Bank  actively  supported  the 
creation  of  an  Energy  Sector  Working  Group  (with  government  and  development  partner 
participants) and has sown the seeds for a coordinated, collaborative future investment program by 
financing the preparation of a Sector Investment Plan.   
59.     Achievements  include  the  following:  i.  through  the  ERTP,  the  Bank  introduced  a  cross
sectoral approach for access expansion, providing key stakeholders in the health, education, water, 
agriculture, and local government sectors a direct role in planning and implementing their energy 
investments; ii. the PP4 made major contributions to improve energy supply and strengthened the 
borrower's capacity to manage reform, privatization and development in the power and petroleum 
sub  sectors;  iii.  PUSRP  contributed  to  an  improved  regulatory  framework  and  investments  in  the 
distribution network are taking place.  In addition, initiatives to reduce technical and nontechnical 
power losses were launched; iv. PSDP successfully contributed to the significant reduction in power 
rationing, in light of delays to the Bujagali dam; v. the Bujagali hydro power project is expected to 
provide leastcost power generation capacity that will eliminate power shortages at the time of its 
commissioning.11 
60.      Looking forward, the key area of emphasis will be access expansion and the generation and 
transmission investments needed to support it.  There will also be an increased focus on regional 
aspects  of  energy  development,  including  regional  interconnections  as  part  of  the  emerging  East 
Africa  power  market,  and  also  assessment  of  domestic  generation  as  it  relates  to  the  regional 
market. 
61.     The main lessons learned are that policy reforms should not be combined with SILs as this 
tends to delay project implementation.  An example is inclusion of sector reforms in PP4 leading to 
commitments beyond the control of the implementing agency, such as the completion  time of the 
Bujagali  hydro  power  project,  and  reduction  of  distribution  network  losses.    These  sector  reform 
issues  would  be  better  addressed  under  the  PRSC  policy  dialogues.    From  ERTP,  general  lessons 

                                                             
10 The Privatization and Utility Sector Reform Project is technically not closed, as there is still a contingent credit.

                                                                 104  
 
learned include the need for assessment of potential private sector investments in rural energy as 
well  as  taking  into  account  institutional  capacity  of  implementing  agencies  at  the  project  design 
stage. 
62.      Bank interventions in the railway sector consisted of two IFC loans ($10m and $22m) to 
Rift  Valley  Railways  (RVR)  to  finance  capital  expenditures  for  the  rehabilitation,  operation,  and 
maintenance of the railway.  The IFC has also acted as an advisor to the Governments of Kenya and 
Uganda  regarding  privatization  of  the  joint  KenyaUganda  railway  line  (see  also  paragraph  155).  
However,  since  RVR  has  experienced  severe  financial  and  operational  difficulties  as  a  result  of 
mismanagement,  and  the  much  poorer  than  expected  condition  of  rolling  stock  and  tracks, 
disbursement of the larger of the two IFC loans is pending restructuring  of RVR.   These activities 
will carry over to the new CAS and results will only be realized then. 
Strategic Objective 2.6: Strengthened Environment and Natural Resource (ENR) 
Management Regime in Support of Sustainable Production of Goods and Services 
63.     Incomplete  data  on  baselines,  target  values  and  status  makes  it  impossible  to  assess  to 
which  extent  SO2.6  was  achieved.    Bank  interventions  did  contribute  to  their  stated  objectives.  
However,  with  none  of  the  PEAP/UJAS  indicators  monitored  and  with  the  ENR  sectorwide 
approach (SWAp) dropped, Bank contribution to SO2.6 is rated moderately unsatisfactory. 
64.     Bank lending operations in support of SO2.6 consisted of the Protected Areas Management 
and  Sustainable  Use  Project  (PAMSU)  and  the  Second  Environmental  Management  and  Capacity 
Building  Project  (EMCBP2).    Both  projects  were  carried  over  from  previous  CASs  and  both  were 
extended,  with  EMCBP2  receiving  additional  financing.    Bank  interventions  did  contribute  to  the 
strengthening  of  institutional  capacity  of  the  main  regulatory  bodies  in  the  ENR  sector  including 
NEMA, UWA and UWEC.  The Bank also contributed to the preparation and launching in 2008 of the 
ENR Sector Investment Plan.  However, the ENR SWAp was dropped because of little interest from 
the Government.  
65.   Lending  operations  were  planned  to  be  complemented  by  analytical  work  on  the  linkage 
between  natural  resource  management,  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  Uganda;  however,  this 
ESW was never finalized and thus had negligible impact. 
66.      A major lesson learned is that environmental issues and concerns, including climate change, 
are  closely  linked  to  sustainable  natural  resource  management.    In  the  rush  to  get  quick  results 
from  national  development  efforts,  this  factor  is  normally  relegated  to  a  secondary  issue.    To  be 
effective  and  achieve  the  desirable  results,  sustainable  ENR  programs  need  better  integration  in 
other development efforts to have the desired impact. 
Strategic Objective 2.7: Strengthened Financial Sector in Support of Increased 
Production of Goods and Services 
67.     Micro  finance  institutions  (MFIs)  served  4.3m  clients  in  2008,  almost  a  fivefold  increase 
over just five years.  The single outcome indicator under SO2.7 thus exceeded the target and, by that 
measure,  the  objective  was  achieved.    Bank  interventions  actively  supported  SO2.7  and  are  thus 
rated satisfactory. 
68.     Bank lending operations in support  of SO2.7 consisted of PSCP2 (see paragraphs  34, 51).  
Nonlending operations in support of a strengthened financial sector included a number of studies 
related to remittances, strengthening of the financial sector and associated reforms.  These enabled 
stakeholders to focus on policy issues and provide a framework on the way forward.  For example, 
work is being done to reform the pension sector and the anti money laundering bill is being tabled 
to Parliament.

PILLAR 3: SECURITY, CONFLICTRESOLUTION AND DISASTERMANAGEMENT 

69.    Under  the  single  strategic  objective  under  Pillar  3,  the  Bank  aimed  at  contributing  to  two 
outcomes measured by three outcome indicators.  Most indicators did not have any baseline values, 
but with targets indicating trends only, it was still possible to assess progress. 
70.      Improvement in the security situation in northern Uganda was reflected in progress on all 
outcome indicators under Pillar 3.  The number of IDPs was reduced by 66% (almost 1.2m people 
returned from IDP camps), the number of casualties as a result of the conflict was reduced, 95% of 
former  rebels  and  their  collaborators  were  resettled  (having  received  amnesty)  and  economic 
activity  in  formerly  conflict  affected  areas  increased.    Consequently,  the  strategic  objective  under 
Pillar  3  was  achieved.    Bank  support  under  Pillar  3,  while  aided  by  positive  external  factors,  was 
successful  in  supporting  improved  livelihoods,  the  return  of  IDPs,  and  reintegration  of  ex
combatants.  Therefore, Bank contribution under pillar 3 was assessed as satisfactory. 
Table 4 ­ Summary Assessment of Bank Contribution to the Strategic Objective under Pillar 3 
PEAP/UJAS Strategic Objective                                          Result         Bank Contribution 
3.1: Protection of persons and their property through                  Achieved       Satisfactory 
elimination of conflicts and cattle rustling, resettlement of IDPs, 
and strengthened disaster management 
     
71.     Bank  Support  under  Pillar  3  consisted  of  both  lending  and  nonlending  products,  the  key 
projects  being  the  Northern  Uganda  Social  Action  Fund  (NUSAF)  project  and  support  to  Amnesty 
Commission  through  the  Multicountry  Demobilization  and  Reintegration  Program  (MDRP).    The 
key  nonlending  products  were  the  Northern  Uganda  PER  and  a  study  on  northern  Uganda  on 
"Land Policy and the Return to Peace".   
72.    Given the importance of external factors in achieving the outcomes, it is difficult to attribute 
progress to Bank interventions.  Nonetheless, it should be acknowledged that Bank alignment of the 
CAS with Pillar 3 of the PEAP was highly relevant and timely.  
73.    The  support  provided  to  the  Uganda  Amnesty  Commission  through  the  Bankmanaged 
MultiCountry  Demobilization  and  Reintegration  Program  (MDRP)  contributed  to  the  return  of 
former rebels to civilian life.  The Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF) was able to allocate 
resources increasingly to areas where displaced people (IDPs) returned when the security situation 
allowed, following the initiation of peace talks between the GoU and the LRA.  
74.       The peace talks initiated in mid 2006, starting with a cessation of hostilities in August 2006, 
contributed significantly to the increased security in northern Uganda.  That in turn led to increased 
economic  activity  and  trade,  incentives  for  IDPs  to  return  to  their  original  settlements,  and  a 
reduced number of casualties as a result of the conflict. These were positive exogenous factors that 
contributed  to  the  achievement  of  CAS  outcomes  and  cannot  be  attributed  to  Bank  interventions.  
The Government deserves credit for having included security and conflict resolution as a separate 
pillar  in  the  PEAP04.    Similarly,  UJAS  partners'  decision  to  include  Pillar  3  and  align  operations 
with  the  strategic  objective  paved  the  way  for  support  to  recovery  and  development  efforts  with 
the cessation of hostilities.  
75.      The combination of one major lending operation (NUSAF) and a few smaller operations and 
nonlending products, notably the northern Uganda PER (NUPER) and the study on the implications 
of  resettlements,  was  appropriate  in  supporting  GoU  in  the  effort  to  reduce  poverty  in  northern 
Uganda and improve the security situation in the region.  The Bank was particularly successful in 
contributing to improved livelihoods among households in northern Uganda: fortyseven percent of 
the population in northern Uganda, against a target of thirty percent, has improved access to social 

                                                       106  
 
services  through  NUSAF,  and  the  MDRP  provided  reinsertion  support  to  almost  15,000  former 
rebels and their collaborators.  The NUPER provided key inputs to GoU and development partners 
in assessing the status and the gaps in resource flows from the central government, humanitarian 
and  development  partners  to  northern  Uganda,  as  well  as  the  allocations  of  expenditures  in  the 
region.  It also provided timely recommendations for the elaboration of the PRDP by GoU.  
76.      Aid coordination in northern Uganda remained a challenge throughout the CAS period, not 
least in the process of development partners switching their focus from humanitarian assistance to 
development  and  rehabilitation  efforts.    With  GoUelaboration  of  a  strategic  framework  for 
recovery and development in northern Uganda, the PRDP, aid coordination is improving. 
77.      The implementation of NUSAF demonstrated that communities in a postconflict are able to 
identify,  plan,  manage,  and  monitor  social  investments  well  suited  to  their  needs;  thus,  even  in  a 
fragile environment, the right project design may contribute to improved bottomup accountability. 

PILLAR 4: GOOD GOVERNANCE 

78.      Under Pillar 4 of the CAS, the Bank sought to contribute to six outcomes under two strategic 
objectives,  measured  by  seven  outcome  indicators.    Several  indicators  are  missing  data  making  it 
difficult  to  assess  performance  based  on  the  outcome  indicators  only.    Rather,  an  assessment  of 
progress towards each strategic objective, and the Bank's attribution, is provided in the following. 
79.     Limited progress was recorded under Pillar 4.  For example, there is a general perception of 
growing corruption and the Government has failed to pursue any of several highprofile corruption 
scandals during the CAS period.  While to a certain extent this may be attributed to external factors, 
the ambitious Bank agenda under Pillar 4 was not followed up with appropriate instruments and 
interventions.    Consequently,  the  Bank's  contribution  under  Pillar  4  is  rated  moderately 
unsatisfactory. 
Table 5 ­ Summary Assessment of Bank Contributions to Strategic Objectives under Pillar 4 
PEAP/UJAS Strategic Objectives                                       Result          Bank Contribution 
4.1: Strengthened legal and justice systems                          Partially       Moderately unsatisfactory
                                                                     achieved 
4.2: Strengthened public sector management and accountability        Not achieved    Moderately unsatisfactory
     
Strategic Objective 4.1: Strengthened Legal and Justice Systems 
80.     Some progress was made on indicators towards the targets under SO4.1, although none of 
the targets were actually met.  On that basis, SO4.1 was only partially achieved.  Bank contributions 
did not match the ambitious objective and is therefore rated moderately unsatisfactory. 
81.     The  Bank's  contribution  towards  SO4.1  consisted  of  PRSC  policy  dialogue  and  the  second 
Private Sector Competitiveness Project (PSCP2).  These interventions contributed to the setting up 
of the AntiCorruption Division of the High Court, improvements in the commercial court system to 
reduce the case backlog and improved access to justice. 
82.     The  Bank  also  worked  on  a  knowledge  product,  the  Legal  and  Judicial  Sector  Assessment.  
An unfinished draft was initially prepared by the end of FY05.  It was subsequently updated in FY08 
and was circulated internally, but has yet to be disseminated to the Government.  The knowledge 
product  was  intended  to  inform  the  sector  dialogues  and  Bank  interventions  going  forward.  
However,  significant  delays  meant  that  the  assessment  had  negligible  impact  and  the  rather  late 
internal  circulation  meant  that  there  was  a  gap  in  informing  policy  dialogue  and  Bank 
interventions. 


                                                      107  
 
83.     A wellfunctioning justice, law and order sector (JLOS) is an important complement to the 
effectiveness  of  other  Bank  interventions.    Looking  forward,  therefore,  the  Bank  should  consider 
providing  support  to  the  sector  beyond  the  PRSC  policy  dialogue,  coordinated  with  support 
provided by other development partners. 
Strategic Objective 4.2: Strengthened Public Sector Management and Accountability 
84.      Progress on outcome indicators under strategic objective 4.2 showed limited progress short 
of  targets  or  deterioration.    Indicators  related  to  corruption  and  local  government  revenue,  have 
worsened  since  the  baseline  year.    Consequently,  SO4.2  was  not  achieved.    In  addition,  the  Public 
Service  Reform  Program  (PSRP)  did  not  achieve  the  expected  results,  e.g.  failure  to  implement 
resultsoriented  management  in  the  public  sector.    Although  semiexternal  factors  such  as 
effectiveness  delays  partly  explain  the  Bank's  limited  contributions  to  SO4.2,  overcall  Bank 
contributions to SO4.2 are rated moderately unsatisfactory.  
85.    Bank  lending  operations  in  support  of  public  sector  management  and  accountability 
included the second Economic and Financial  Management Project (EFMP2) and the second Local 
Government Development Project (LGDP2), both carried over from previous CASs.   
86.     In  the  area  of  local  government  development,  the  Bank  used  a  combination  of  policy 
dialogue  through  the  PRSCs  and  investment  lending  under  LGDP2  to  assist  the  Government 
develop,  publish  and  rollout  the  Harmonized  Participatory  Planning  Guide  (HPPG)  to  improve 
planning and budgeting at local governments (LG); implement the Fiscal Decentralization Strategy; 
and the restructuring and support to the Local Government Service Commission to recruit new staff 
to  operationalize  the  new  local  government  structures.    The  Bank  also  contributed  to  ensuring 
compensation of LGs for taxes abolished. 
87.     The  EFMP2  successfully  contributed  to  improve  government  planning,  budgeting  and 
financial  management.    Effective  since  FY00,  the  project  achieved  most  of  its  results  prior  to  this 
CAS period.  Three other projects (KIIDP, LGMSDP, UPSPEP) were approved during the CAS period, 
but  did  not  reach  effectiveness  until  November  2008.    Thus,  those  projects  did  not  deliver  any 
results in the period under review. 
88.    The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment highlighted several 
challenges relating to enhancing transparency in budget execution.  These issues are being followed 
up with the PRSC8 operation, and the PEFA assessment provided insights to the design of the Joint 
Assessment Framework under the Joint Budget Support Framework.   
89.     Bank  support  towards  improved  accountability  suffered  from  the  lack  of  studies  on 
accountability  and  corruption  to  inform  PRSC  policy  dialogue,  even  if  the  issue  was  covered 
indirectly  in  PERs  (e.g.  absenteeism  and  other  waste  in  the  education  and  health  sectors).    For 
example,  baselines  on  locally  relevant  actionable  governance  indicators  need  to  be  established 
prior to inclusion as prior actions in PRSCs. 
90.      In  order  to  support  strengthened  public  sector  management  and  accountability  in  the 
future,  the  Bank  must  adopt  a  clearer  framework  with  actionable  governance  indicators  and 
tracking mechanisms in support of the GAC agenda under the new CAS.  Not least in the run up to 
general  elections  in  2011,  the  Bank  will  need  to  consider  its  role  visàvis  other  development 
partners with respect to advancing the GAC agenda in Uganda.

PILLAR 5: HUMAN DEVELOPMENT 

91.     The  Bank  CAS  program  under  Pillar  5  included  14  outcomes  measured  by  20  outcome 
indicators  grouped  under  four  strategic  objectives  relating  to  education,  health,  water  and 
sanitation, and empowered communities.  As is the case for other pillars, several indicators did not 
have a baseline and/or where not monitored. 
92.     Bank  interventions  under  this  pillar  consisted  of  lending  through  PRSCs,  stand  alone 
projects, and nonlending (e.g. PERs focusing on health and education, and water sector reviews).  
The PRSCs were the main vehicle to support specific actions under the human development pillar.   
Table 6 ­ Summary Assessment of Bank Contributions to the Strategic Objectives under Pillar 5 
PEAP/UJAS Strategic Objectives                                         Result            Bank Contribution 
5.1: Better educated Ugandans                                          Partially         Satisfactory 
                                                                       achieved 
5.2: Healthier Ugandans                                                Partially         Moderately unsatisfactory
                                                                       achieved 
5.3: Improved access to safe water supply and sanitation               Partially         Moderately satisfactory
                                                                       achieved 
5.4: Revitalized community development function                        Not achieved      Moderately unsatisfactory
     
93.     Performance under Pillar 5 was mixed.  Only two out of 14 outcomes were fully achieved, 
eight outcomes were partially achieved, while four outcomes were not achieved.  In particular, the 
health  sector  and  community  development  saw  limited  progress.    The  Bank  made  significant 
contributions  towards  the  progress  in  education  and  water  and  sanitation  through  lending,  PRSC 
policy dialogue and through analytical work. However, support to the human development agenda 
through  PRSCs  in  some  cases  proved  ineffective  in  targeting  systemic  impediments  in  service 
delivery  within  the  sectors.  On  that  basis,  Bank  contribution  under  Pillar  5  is  rated  moderately 
satisfactory. 
Strategic Objective 5.1: Better Educated Ugandans 
94.      Progress was recorded on several of the PEAP/UJAS indicators for education.  Particularly, 
the  target  for  primary  enrollment  was  surpassed,  while  the  target  for  secondary  enrollment  was 
almost  met.  Primary  completion  rates  remain  low  (47%)  and  did  not  meet  the  target  (69%).  
Results  for  post  primary  enrollment  and  completion  rates  as  well  as  tertiary  enrollment  were 
slightly below target.   
95.     Uganda  has  made  progress  towards  MDG2  (primary  school  completion)  in  terms  of 
reaching full enrollment, but low completion rates continue to pose a challenge for the outcomes in 
education.    Relatively  high  rates  of  girls  to  boys  at  all  levels  of  education  indicate  that  Uganda  is 
making  progress  in  achieving  gender  equality  in  education  (MDG3).  Yet,  challenges  remain  with 
regards  to  low  completion  rates  and  substandard  quality  of  primary  and  secondary  education, 
including high rates of absenteeism of teachers and increasing pupilteacher ratios.  On this basis, 
SO5.1 was only partially achieved. 
96.     Through  the  PRSCs,  the  Bank  provided  support  to  the  education  sector  reforms  including 
undertaking the primary education curriculum review process and contributing towards sustained 
resource  flows  to  the  sector.  The  focus  on  supporting  GoU  in  improving  the  quality  of  education 
rather than just expanding coverage was a step in the right direction.  Other lending included the 
Millennium  Science  Initiative,  which  led  to  some  improvements  in  the  quality  of  science  and 
engineering  graduates,  science  and  technology  research,  and  coordination  of  growthoriented 
science initiatives.  In addition, the Makerere Service Delivery Pilot Project, which was undertaken 


                                                        109  
 
in  partnership  with  the  Rockefeller  Foundation,  supported  local  government  capacity  building 
undertaken  by  universities  as  well  as  reform  of  education  and  training  activities  at  Makerere 
University.  The project succeeded in establishing partnerships between universities on curriculum 
reform and provided training to more than 2,000 academic and local government staff.   
97.    Among  the  analytical  work  undertaken,  the  PER  2007  pointed  to  inefficiencies  in  primary 
education  such  as  teacher  absenteeism,  inefficient  teacher  deployment,  and  underfunding  of  non
wage expenditures in public schools.  Subsequently, the Bank initiated institutional support to the 
Directorate  of  Education  Standards  to  strengthen  teacher  supervision  systems  through 
partnerships with the Ministry of Local Government.  
98.     The  combined  lending  and  nonlending  Bank  activities  under  SO5.1  were  relatively 
successful, not only in implementing the strategies laid out in the CAS, but also through the policy 
dialogue  with  GoU  in  terms  of  identifying  core  problems,  initiating  and  sequencing  reforms  and 
addressing  quality  issues  in  the  education  sector.    On  this  basis,  the  performance  of  the  Bank  is 
rated satisfactory. 
99.      Bank  interventions  in  the  education  sector  in  the  next  CAS  should  focus  on  quality  of 
education, partnerships with the private sector to reduce the cost of education service delivery, and 
efforts  to  track  and  address  education  unit  costs  and  quality  gaps.    Further,  interventions  should 
include  strategies  for  schooltowork  transition  and  skills  training  (Business,  Technical  and 
Vocational Education and Training). 
Strategic Objective 5.2: Healthier Ugandans 
100. Only limited progress against the PEAP/UJAS outcomes were recorded under SO5.2, partly 
explained  by  the  limited  availability  of  frequent  data.    Maternal  and  child  mortality  rates  remain 
high and HIV/AIDS prevalence rates, which saw sharp reduction in the 1990s, recently increased.  
At  the  current  pace,  Uganda  is  unlikely  to  meet  MDG4  (child  mortality)  and  MDG5  (maternal 
health),  but  will  most  likely  achieve  MDG6  (combat  HIV/AIDS,  malaria).    However,  the  health 
sector indicators could be argued to be too highlevel, unrealistic to meet over the short period, and 
difficult to monitor on a timely and regular basis.  Further, an increase in HIV/AIDS prevalence rate 
could reflect that more people now have access to ARVs even if the incidence is declining.   
101. The sector faces a number of major challenges: governance and accountability problems are 
rampant,  as  demonstrated  with  the  two  cases  of  misappropriation  of  funds  from  vertical  funds 
(GAVI and Global Fund); population growth continues to increase the demand for health services; 
and  the  sector  allocation  from  the  national  budget  is  declining.    Together,  these  challenges 
contributed  to  the  poor  results  recorded  in  the  sector,  which  is  therefore  assessed  to  be  only 
partially achieved.  
102. Bank assistance towards SO5.2 was mainly provided in the form of: i. support through the 
PRSCs;  ii.  the  Uganda  AIDS  Control  Project  (UACP);  and  iii.  economic  sector  work  in  the  form  of 
annual health sector reviews, the 2008 health sector PER, and the Health Systems Support report.  
While  providing  analytical  advice  and  support  to  the  Health  Sector  Investment  Plan,  Bank 
interventions  were  not  fully  effective  in  achieving  the  targets  set  and  actions  planned,  which, 
among other things, included support to reproductive health, family planning, malaria control, and 
provision  of  skilled  health  workers.    On  that  basis,  Bank  performance  is  rated  moderately 
unsatisfactory. 
103. Through a combination of analytical work and the PRSCs, the Bank was partially effective in 
shaping  the  policy  dialogue  and  agenda,  including  support  to  human  resources  management  and 
procurement  reforms.    The  2008  health  sector  PER  documented  widespread  waste  and 
absenteeism  in  the  sector  and  highlighted  resource  gaps,  and  the  policy  recommendations  now 


                                                      110  
 
provide  the  foundation  for  sector  reforms  and  a  Bank  project  currently  under  preparation  to 
support  health  systems  strengthening.    Further,  the  CEM  successfully  put  the  issue  of  high 
population growth rates on the domestic policy agenda by adopting an indirect approach of looking 
at the economic and fiscal consequences of unchecked population growth.  
104. The  Uganda  AIDS  Control  Project  supported  capacity  building  at  central,  district  and 
community  level  and  played  an  important  role  in  shaping  the  Government's  response  to  the 
epidemic, but most results were achieved under the previous CAS. 
105. Lessons  learned  from  the  CAS  highlight  that  PRSCs  may  not  always  provide  the  optimal 
instrument  for  addressing  health  specific  problems,  and  the  CAS  program  for  the  sector  was  not 
realistic  and  commensurate  with  the  interventions  undertaken.    This  was  particularly  true  when 
GoU's  priorities  during  CAS  implementation  changed  towards  productive  sectors.    In  response  to 
this and to GoU demands, the Bank is now preparing a standalone health sector project.   
106. Looking  forward,  population  is  likely  to  play  a  prominent  role  in  the  GoU's  NDP,  which 
should be reflected in the next CAS.  However, rather than a standalone issue, population should be 
embedded in a broader crosssectoral framework looking not just at health and family planning, but 
also focusing on youth unemployment, skills training, and public service delivery. 
Strategic Objective 5.3: Water and Sanitation 
107. While  some  progress  in  water  and  sanitation  were  noted,  the  results  fell  short  of  the 
PEAP/UJAS  targets.    Nevertheless,  the  improvements  indicate  that  Uganda  is  on  track  to  meet  or 
even  exceed  the  corresponding  MDG  targets,  e.g.  proportion  of  population  having  access  to  safe 
water  facilities  (target:  62%;  status:  65%)  and  sanitation  facilities  (target:  72%;  status:  68%).  
Significant  progress  was  recorded  on  improved  water  facility  maintenance  and  the  target  was 
almost  achieved.    On  the  other  hand,  the  lack  of  progress  in  sanitation  provision  and  hygiene 
mitigation  had  negative  effects  on  achievement  of  MDGs  in  the  area  of  infant,  child  and  maternal 
mortality.    On  this  basis,  SO5.3  was  partially  achieved.    Bank  interventions  were  generally 
successful,  as  interventions  were  able  to  address  sector  wide  challenges  such  as  an  insufficient 
regulatory  framework  as  well  as  coordination  of  efforts  between  ministries.    Therefore,  Bank 
contribution is rated moderately satisfactory. 
108. The Bank provided support to the water  and sanitation sector via lending through PRSCs, 
NUSAF, outputbased aid pilot projects to improve access to piped drinking water in small towns, 
and analytical work.  The Bank  also  provided support through the Water and Sanitation Program 
(WSP), focusing on strengthening the sanitation interventions of GoU.  WSP contributed to raise the 
profile  of  sanitation  in  the  second  Health  Sector  Strategic  Plan  (HSSPII)  and  in  the  PEAP04, 
leading to a better integration and efficient use of resource at district and subdistrict levels.  
109. Through  policy  dialogue,  the  Bank  highlighted  the  importance  of  hygiene  and  sanitation 
interventions, functionality of water facilities, value for money, better resource allocation between 
sectors,  sector  capacity  building,  integrated  water  resources  management,  equity  issues,  and 
governance  issues  in  the  sector,  and  linkages  to  the  Ministry  of  Health.    The  PRSC  and  SWAp 
processes supported the development of improved and more specific sector plans.  Through PRSC 
prior  actions,  debt  of  the  National  Water  and  Sewerage  Cooperation  (NWSC)  was  written  off, 
making NWSC more attractive for private financing.  Further, the Bank assisted the Government in 
creating  additional  propoor  services  and  the  NWSC  created  a  propoor  unit.    In  addition,  the 
recommendations  of  a  study  on  governance  issues  and  service  delivery  in  the  sector  informed 
sector planning and the draft National Development Plan.  
                                   



                                                    111  
 
Strategic Objective 5.4: Community Development 
110. The Bank's support towards SO5.4 was an integrated part of the PRSC series.  In addition to 
lending, the Bank developed a policy note on Civic Engagement and Social Accountability.  
111. PEAP/UJAS targets were not achieved and only saw very limited progress.  Thus, community 
development  workers  and  community  development  management  committees  were  not  increased 
in numbers, capacity and management as planned.  Bank contributions did not match the intended 
objectives and is rated moderately unsatisfactory. 
112. As  much  as  policy  reforms  were  expedited  and  completed  during  the  CAS  period,  only 
limited progress was noted on actual implementation of policies.   Thus, the National Gender Policy 
was  approved  in  2007,  but  the  policy  has  yet  to  be  implemented;  the  Equal  Opportunities 
Commission  was  established  in  2007,  but  has  yet  to  be  operationalized;  the  Community 
Mobilization  and  Empowerment  Strategy  was  only  partly  implemented;  and  the  Community 
Development Policy was never finalized. 
113. A number of factors have contributed to the lack of progress under this strategic objective: i. 
the  Ministry  of  Gender,  Labour  and  Social  Development  is  very  resourceconstrained;  ii.  political 
support  for  implementation  of  the  national  gender  policy  remains  vague;  and  iii.  the  increased 
number  of  districts  have  put  districts  and  subcounties  under  increased  fiscal  pressure.    Despite 
these challenges, Uganda launched gender budgeting as a crosscutting issue in the national budget 
process in 2009. 
114. The  PRSCs,  mainly  focusing  on  macro  level  reforms  across  financial  and  social  sectors,  do 
not  seem  to  have  been  the  best  available  instrument  for  influencing  change  regarding  the 
community development component of the PEAP.  In retrospect, using the existing interventions on 
decentralization  and  public  sector  reforms  could  have  provided a  much  more  direct  and  possibly 
more effective intervention. 
115. The  policy  note  on  institutionalizing  Civic  Engagement  and  Social  Accountability  for 
improved  development  outcomes  provided  specific  recommendations  to  GoU  on  harmonizing 
collaboration for improved social accountability.  Some of its recommendations (e.g. elaboration of 
NGO  policy  and  an  NGO  quality  assurance  certification  mechanism)  were  since  taken  up  by  the 
Government and stakeholders, but otherwise the note suffered from lack of follow up in the policy 
dialogue and lack of interconnection to other sectors and operations.

VOLUME, LENDING AND COSTS ­ IDA 

116. The  CAS  projected  new  IDA  commitments  to  reach  $1,000m  over  the  FY0609  CAS 
period.  By the end of FY09, actual new IDA commitments amounted to $1,287m, cf. Annex 2 and 
Figure 3.  The increase in total commitments was largely due to the record amounts raised for IDA
15 and to Uganda's consistently high performance in CPIA ratings.12  The PRSCs were reduced from 
$600m to $460m over the CAS period.  Combined with the increase in the overall program, PRSC's 
share of overall new lending in the period declined from the planned 60 percent to 36 percent.13  
                                                             
12 Uganda scored 3.9 in the IDA Resource Allocation Index every year from 200508, consistently higher than the IDA 

borrowers' average of 3.3. 
13 PRSCs 58 were planned as singletranche one year operations each amounting to $150m.  PRSC5 and PRSC6 were 

reduced by $40m in total, mainly due to limited followup on prior actions by the Government.  The planned PRSC7 and 
PRSC8 were merged in a dualtranche twoyear operation amounting to $200m (PRSC7).  See also paragraph 135 below. 

                                                                 112  
 
117. Nineteen projects were planned for delivery during the CAS period of which only ten 
were  delivered.14    However,  seven  new  projects,  including  two  regional  projects  and  three 
additional  financing  operations,  were  delivered  over  the  period,  bringing  the  total  number  of 
projects delivered to 17, cf. Figure 4.  A number of projects slipped one or two financial years, partly 
because  preceding  projects  in  the  same  sector  experienced  implementation  delays  (e.g.  local 
government and energy).

118. Allocations by sector and pillar of delivered projects deviated substantially from the 
planned lending program.  As detailed in paragraphs 21 and 22, commitments to projects in the 
energy, education and social protection sectors significantly exceeded planned commitments, while 
delivered commitments for PRSCs, public sector and the transport sector were lower than planned.  
119. Total projects under implementation during this period averaged 18 projects (only IDA 
credits),  with  an  average  total  commitment  of  $1,276m.    World  Bank  Group  disbursements  to 
Uganda during the CAS period amounted to $754m, in addition to IFC and MIGA guarantees, loans 
and equities amounting to $164m and $171m respectively. 
120. The  project  portfolio  consisted  of  twentytwo  IDA  lending  operations  at  the  end  of 
FY09  (including  four  regional  projects  and  one  guarantee),  of  which  12  were  projects  approved 
during  FY200609.    According  to  ISRs,  fourteen  projects  were  rated  satisfactory,  five  moderately 
satisfactory, one unsatisfactory, while two projects were not yet effective.  
121. A total of fourteen projects closed from FY06FY09, cf. Annex 5.15  ICRs were available 
for eleven of the projects that exited the portfolio, but only nine of these were reviewed by IEG, cf. 
Annex 6.16  IEG rated outcomes of five projects (56%) satisfactory, two projects (22%) were rated 
moderately  satisfactory,  while  two  projects  were  rated  moderately  unsatisfactory.    These  ratings 
were generally in accordance with ICR ratings, although there were three  disconnects, where IEG 
rated  outcomes  lower  than  the  ICRs.17    Bank  performance,  borrower  performance,  and  quality  of 
Bank  supervision  were  generally  rated  moderately  satisfactory  or  satisfactory  by  IEG  with  two 
                                                             
14 Excluding the Private Power Generation Guarantee (Bujagali). 
15 This excludes two GEF projects: Lake Victoria Environment and Energy for Rural Transformation. 
16 At the time of CASCR finalization, ICRs were available for NUSAF and ERT, but no IEG reviews were yet available. Both 

projects were rated Satisfactory. A joint ICR is under preparation for the PRSC 57 series; thus, individual ICRs are not 
available for PRSC5 and PRSC6. 
17 Disconnects for the three projects are generally related to overambitious development objectives and targets, and 

indications of performance targets not having been met. 

                                                                             113  
 
exceptions.    IEG  ratings  of  quality  at  entry  reveal  some  weaknesses,  notably  because  of  poor 
monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  quality  ratings.    The  main  problems  with  M&E  quality  were 
related  to  inadequacies  and  lack  of  indicators  and  baselines  at  design  stage,  limited  follow  up  on 
indicators during implementation, and insufficient utilization of M&E systems in terms of tracking 
project outcomes.  
122. Key  lessons  learned  from  projects  completed  and  evaluated  during  the  CAS  period 
include the following: 
      i.   APL  phases  should  be  executed  sequentially  and  not  simultaneously  to  allow  systematic 
           integration of lessons learned from one phase to the next. 
     ii.   Welldesigned  risk  assessments  and  results  frameworks  are  crucial  for  success  in 
           implementation and lack of these may hamper project outcomes. 
    iii.   When undertaking institutional reforms, it is crucial to take into account the existing level of 
           capacity  and  adequately  account  for  it  through  provision  of  technical  assistance.    In 
           addition,  project  designs  should  be  realistic  with  respect  to  institutional  reform 
           achievements and consider phasing of reforms and associated projects. 
    iv.    The Bank should consider restructuring projects showing significant implementation delays. 
     v.    Regional  projects  require  strong  emphasis  on  clarity  of  project  objectives,  M&E 
           frameworks, governance and management systems, and clear accountability structures.   
123. These  recommendations  have  subsequently  been  addressed  through  the  introduction  of 
standardized M&E reviews of all new project packages, application of coherent and sequenced APL 
phases,  and  undertaking  restructuring  or  comprehensive  reviews  of  operations  that  are 
significantly  delayed  (e.g.  UPSPEP).    The  challenges  identified  should  be  closely  monitored  under 
the new CAS. 

124. The  disbursement  rate  averaged                     Figure 5 ­  Commitments and Disbursements FY9009 
24.3%  over  the  period  reflecting                             US$m                                           US$m
improvements  in  FY08  and  FY09.    The                    1,500                                                  300
disbursement rate for Uganda compares well 
with  the  regional  average  of  21.9%  over  the           1,250                                                   250

Uganda  to  an  all  time  high  of  more  than               750                                                    150

were reduced from 23 projects in FY01 to 16                   250                                                    50

                                                                  0                                                  0

highs.   
125. The average age for projects closed during the CAS period was 7.4 years (excl. PRSCs 
and GEF), compared to the regional average of five years.  Further, only one of the projects exiting 
the  portfolio  during  the  CAS  period  (excl.  PRSCs)  did  not  extend  the  closing  date.    This  reflects 
delays to effectiveness and underestimation of implementation times.      


                                                          114  
 
126. Project  portfolio  performance  has  been  satisfactory  overall,  cf.  Annex  4.    From  FY06
FY09,  five  to  thirtyfive  percent  of  projects  were  at  risk  and  six  projects  were  rated  as  problem 
projects.    The  main  reasons  for  problem  status  were  effectiveness  delays,  implementation  delays, 
and  slow  disbursements.    All  problem  projects  improved  their  status  quickly  due  to  proactive 
interventions  from  project  teams,  as  evidenced  by  high  proactivity  rating.    The  (revised)  realism 
index  stood  at  71  percent  by  the  end  of  FY09,  compared  to  the  43  percent  average  for  the  Africa 
Region. 
127. Project  preparation  and  supervision  costs.    Project  preparation  costs  (IDA  only) 
averaged  $329,000,  compared  to  the  regional  average  of  $478,000,  over  the  period.    Average 
supervision cost per project amounted to approximately $108,000, on par with the regional average 
of  $103,000.    There  is  evidence  that  the  supervision  budget  provided  was  sufficient  and  ensured 
good quality project supervision.  However, a safeguards review of the portfolio completed in FY09 
indicated  that  while  safeguards  risks  are  generally  managed  well  in  the  portfolio,  some  projects 
suffer  from  limited  and  inconsistent  supervision  of  safeguards  issues,  especially  for  social 
safeguards (see also paragraph 135). 
128. Effectiveness  delays.    At  the  end  of  FY09,  ten  of  the  projects  in  the  Uganda  portfolio 
experienced effectiveness delays between eight and twentynine months.18  Effectiveness delays are 
usually  caused  by  delays  to  Parliamentary  approval,  a  requirement  for  IDA  credits  in  Uganda.    In 
most  cases,  delays  were  due  to  inadequate  consultations  between  the  implementing  government 
agencies  and  Parliament,  through  the  various  stages  of  project  preparation.    In  many  cases, 
effectiveness  delays  increased  the  risk  of  subsequent  implementation  difficulties  and  need  for 
thorough review or restructuring, as project relevance, priorities and appropriateness of design are 
likely to decline over time.  However, given that parliamentary approval is required for all credits in 
Uganda,  projects  under  the  new  CAS  should  anticipate  effectiveness  delays  in  the  project 
implementation  plan  and  task  teams  should  encourage  involvement  of  major  stakeholders  at  the 
design stage.  
129. Economic rate of return for investments.  Among projects evaluated by IEG, assessments 
of economic rate of returns (ERR) were carried out for five projects.19  Findings show that all five 
projects  had  an  ERR  within  the  margin  planned  from  the  outset,  with  four  projects  showing  a 
higher ERR than anticipated. 
130. M&E issues at national, CAS and project level.  The Government focused on building the 
necessary  capacity  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  PEAP  through  the  development  and 
implementation  of  the  National  Integrated  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Strategy  (NIMES).    Several 
mechanisms were put in place including the creation of the National M&E Technical Working Group 
to coordinate and improve the quality and use of M&E across Government, and the organization of 
an Annual Policy Implementation Review (APIR) process to assess progress in the implementation 
of  the  PEAP.    However,  major  challenges  in  tracking  the  progress  on  PEAP/UJAS  indicators  (and 
thus the CAS indicators) appeared during CAS implementation, due to lack of baselines, timeliness, 
and  frequency  of  indicators.    At  the  project  level,  monitoring  progress  on  outputs  and  outcomes 
remains a challenge.  Monitoring and evaluation assessments and training were undertaken during 
the  CAS  period,  and  project  teams  were  advised  to  retrofit  their  results  frameworks  to  refine 
objectives and indicators, and improve project M&E systems.  However, for a few projects or APLs 
with  several  phases  (designed  prior  to  the  CAS  period  assessed),  shortcomings  regarding  the 
quality of the results frameworks were still observed, according to IEG ICR evaluations. 
                                                             
18 Of the 17 national projects under implementation at the start of FY10, only seven were declared effective within the 

required 90 days from signing of the financing agreement.

131. Only  one  Country  Portfolio  Performance  Review  (CPPR)  took  place  during  this  CAS 
period in December 2007.20  The CPPR contributed to improved project performance and dialogue 
with the Government.  The Joint Portfolio Review of December 2007 identified weaknesses of the 
Bank's  portfolio  in  Uganda,  remedies,  agencies  responsible  for  actions,  and  a  timeline  for 
implementation.    The  weaknesses  identified  included:  i.  inadequate  project  identification, 
preparation and designs; ii. shortcomings in quality of results frameworks; iii. procurement delays; 
iv.  inefficient  and  expensive  services  of  the  Bank  of  Uganda  (the  central  bank);  and  v.  local 
knowledge and insights are often disregarded by the Bank.  The CPPR pointed to five key areas that 
need continuous follow up:   i. compliance with project readiness criteria; ii. more effective project 
management;  iii.  improved  procurement  management;  iv.  accelerated  implementation  of  an  anti
corruption framework; and v. strengthening M&E and results management in the Government and 
the  Bank  ISR  process.    Project  coordination  units  were  set  up  within  relevant  government 
ministries,  and  they  regularly  discuss  crosscutting  project  implementation  issues  and  followup 
actions  from  the  CPPRs.    The  Bank  has  increased  focus  on  governance  and  anticorruption  (GAC) 
both  at  project  level,  sector  level  and  the  national  level.    Still,  the  Bank  could  have  done  more  to 
follow up on the recommendations from the CPPR and review progress against the action plan.  
132. A Gender Audit of the country portfolio was completed in June 2007.  The audit revealed 
that  while  almost  a  third  of  the  Bank  projects  active  at  the  time  directly  addressed  the  most 
pressing  gender  issues  in  the  country,  a  large  number  of  projects  do  not  systematically  integrate 
gender  concerns  in  their  design.  The  Gender  Audit  Report  provided  recommendations  on  gender 
awareness  and  capacity  building  among  project  staff,  application  of  gender  analysis  in  project 
design  and  implementation  (including  M&E  frameworks)  and  strengthening  institutional 
accountability  for  gender  mainstreaming  in  Bank  operations  (including  representation  on  project 
beneficiary  groups,  integration  in  PAD,  and  use  of  gender  disaggregated  data).  Recommendations 
were followed up in subsequent operations where relevant. 
133. Financial Management. Ratings for safeguards and fiduciary aspects were satisfactory and 
no  projects  had  any  substantial  issues  to  be  raised  regarding  safeguards  and  fiduciary  issues. 
However, a few crosscutting issues in financial management are affecting implementation: i. Bank 
of  Uganda's  (BoU)  services  are  not  fully  satisfactory.    A  few projects  still  receive  bank  statements 
with errors and there are instances of delays in crediting funds disbursed by the World Bank to the 
projects' special accounts.  BoU is at an advanced stage in procuring a new banking software system 
to address this issue; ii. Internal audits.  Most projects that are mainstreamed within ministries do 
not have their activities integrated into work plans of internal audit units to review their internal 
control systems and ensure their adequacy.  The Office of the Auditor General, in collaboration with 
the Bank, conducts annual financial audits and issues management letters to accompany the audits, 
highlighting  the  internal  control  and  accountability  issues  therein.    In  case  of  risks  identified  and 
requiring value for money or forensic audits, these are also commissioned. 
134. The implementation of procurement streamlining has significantly progressed during the 
CAS period, but a number of challenges remain.  The focus on building a regulatory framework and 
the  assignment  of  an  additional  Procurement  Specialist  at  the  World  Bank  Country  Office 
strengthened procurement management in the Bank's portfolio in Uganda.  However, procurement 
delays  for  many  projects  have  resulted  in  late  delivery  of  the  required  items  (goods,  works  and 
consulting services) to the intended beneficiaries, particularly in infrastructure sectors. Such delays 
slow  down  project  implementation  and  are  due  to  a  combination  of  factors,  including:  i.  weak 
project  management  oversight  and  procurement  capacity  among  project  staff;  ii.  challenges 
associated  with  the  unique  and  innovative  nature  of  some  contracts,  e.g.  in  the  energy  sector;  iii. 
inadequate  technical  skills,  and  iv.  poor  project  management.  The  Bank  will  continue  to  address 
                                                             
20 Previous CPPRs in Uganda were completed in 2001 and 2005. A new CPPR for Uganda was completed in early CY10. 



                                                        116  
 
these  challenges  through  support  via  specialists  based  in  the  country  office,  hiring  of  additional 
consultants for complex projects, and introducing performance evaluation of project managers and 
coordinators to improve results. 
135. The  safeguards  portfolio  review  carried  out  in  FY09  found  environmental  and  social 
risks of the portfolio well managed, with a high degree of compliance with the safeguards policies. 
The  shortcomings  identified  through  the  review  included:  i.  weak  capacity  in  some  counterpart 
agencies;  ii.  environment  assessment  miscategorization  of  several  projects;  and  iii.  safeguards 
understaffing,  although  capacity  to  manage  safeguards  in  country  was  enhanced  by  posting 
additional  safeguards  staff  in  the  Country  Office.    It  was  also  observed  that  while  safeguards 
concerns are included during project preparation, there is limited supervision and follow up during 
implementation,  partly  due  to  understaffing.    On  the  social  safeguards  side,  lack  of  a  national 
resettlement policy continues to pose a challenge. 
136. In  conclusion,  the  Bank  delivered  a  larger  lending  program  with  fewer  projects  than 
projected in the CAS.  Apart from minor gaps in project preparation and supervision, the quality of 
project  implementation,  outcomes  and  portfolio  performance  was  generally  satisfactory  and  cost 
effective.  The  Bank  delivered  more  IDA  support  to  the  energy,  education  and  social  protection 
sectors, and less through PRSCs and to the transport sector than planned; however, this was partly 
explained  by  the  Bank's  flexibility  in  responding  to  changing  client  priorities.    While  portfolio 
performance  was  generally  good,  there  is  still  room  for  improvement  in  addressing  quality  of 
project preparation and effectiveness delay issues, and ensuring efficient project implementation. 
        
                                                          Box 5: Bujagali Inspection Panel Case 
One major safeguard issue during this CAS was the Bujagali Inspection Panel Case. Responding to a request in 
March 2007 from the National Association of Professional Environmentalists (NAPE), a Ugandan non
governmental organization, the Inspection Panel investigated the World Bank's compliance with its 
operational policies on potential environmental, economic, and social impacts.  The Panel found the Bank in 
compliance with several policy provisions, including assessing project impacts on fisheries, establishing a 
dam safety panel, issuing land titles to projectaffected people, and completing a baseline hydrologic data 
series.  It also found a number of cases of noncompliance such as assessments of project alternatives and 
cumulative impacts, exclusion of Lake Victoria from the project's area of influence, and in the assessment of 
project costs, risks, and impacts on electricity tariffs.  The Panel commended the Bank for its work on 
conserving the Kalagala Falls area as an environmental offset to the Bujagali project, responding to the 
Panel's earlier investigation. On December 12, 2008, the Board of Directors discussed the Inspection Panel 
Report and the Management Response to the report.  The Board noted that the Bank should remain engaged 
in Uganda's energy sector, and some Board members expressed that the Bujagali project was an example of 
an improved World Bank Group approach to infrastructure projects, and a commitment to address 
associated economic, environmental, and social dimensions of development projects.  Members eventually 
approved the range of actions set forth in the Management Response and the additional actions that 
management intends to undertake in view of the Inspection Panel investigation and Board deliberations.21 
 

 


                                                             
21   The Bank team agreed on a Management Action Plan that includes: timely implementation of a sustainable 

management plan for Kalagala Falls; updating and implementation of a cultural property management plan; and 
undertaking an enhanced socioeconomic study to support and fully achieve livelihood restoration.  Management will 
undertake these actions in consultation with the Government of Uganda, affected people and the project sponsor.  In 
addition, management will develop guidance on how to address environmental and social safeguard issues in legacy 
projects that suffer from interruptions in implementation, such as in the Bujagali project.  The Management Action Plan is 
currently being implemented. 

                                                                          117  
 
IDA NONLENDING 

137. The CAS contains two different sets of projections for ESW delivery: one indicates 27 ESWs 
to be delivered over the period while the other mixes TAs, ESWs, and technical memoranda such as 
the  JSAN  and  DSAs.    This  makes  it  difficult  to  accurately  assess  the  delivery  of  ESWs  against  CAS 
targets. However, a manual count indicates that a total of 20 ESWs and three TAs were planned for 
the  CAS  period,  while  at  the  end  of  the  CAS  period,  a  total  of  20  ESWs  and  nine  TAs  had  been 
delivered. 

138. There were some delays in delivery                            Figure 6 ­ Delivery of Economic Sector Work, FY0609 
of AAA, as shown in Figure 6 and in Annex 3, 
with  12  of  the  planned  ESWs  delivered  in  the                 8

latter part of the CAS period.  In addition, some                    7
ESWs  were  not  produced  as  outlined  in  the                     6
CAS,  and  several  ESWs  not  included  in  the 
original CAS were delivered.  Two ESWs were                          5

dropped  after  having  incurred  significant                        4
costs.    In  some  cases,  delays  in  delivery  may                3
have  a  negative  impact  on  the  impact  of  the 
analytical  work  and  also  provides  a  weaker                     2

quality.22    Improvements  can  be  made, 
however,  in  timing,  dissemination  (especially  of  ESWs  with  crosssectoral  relevance),  planning  of 
the  output,  and  coordinating  with  Government  and  other  development  partners.    The  Country 
Economic  Memorandum,  along  with  the  Public  Expenditure  Reviews  of  2007  and  2008,  helped 
shape the policy dialogue with the Government and assisted in identifying priorities and strategic 
directions for GoU and Bank interventions.  This is evidenced by the CEM and PERs being cited in 
various GoU policy and planning documents.  
140. Nine TAs funded by the Bank budget were completed during this CAS.  Technical assistance 
was mostly provided to complement existing operations and often focused on one particular event 
or product, including Presidential Investor Round Table events, technical reforms, and support to 
policy  reforms  (PRDP,  ICT  Policy).    Future  CASs  would  benefit  from  a  clear  outline  of  timing, 
content and priority of TAs.  
141. The  relevance  and  timeliness  of  ESW  visàvis  the  dialogue  with  the  client,  as  well  as  the 
direct  impact  of  ESW  findings  and  recommendations  on  policy  reforms,  are  both  indications  that 
the  nonlending  program  was  performing  well,  despite  some  products  that  were  not  sufficiently 
followed up in the client dialogue, and some planned ESWs not delivered. 

IDA INSTRUMENTS 

142. As described in detail in earlier sections, the PRSCs showed declining performance over the 
CAS period.  For example the slow progress on reforms under the latest  PRSC7 indicates that the 
speed and effectiveness of implementation of the PRSCs and prior actions have been reduced. 

                                                             
22 No formal evaluations or reviews have been carried out of ESWs on Uganda completed FY06FY09. 



                                                                 118  
 
143. The relatively high number of APLs in projects delivered during the CAS period (five out of 
17)  is  a  sign  of  the  willingness  and  interest  of  the  Bank  and  GoU  to  engage  in  phased,  longterm 
reform programs in the energy, transport, and education sectors. 
144.     During  this  CAS,  Uganda  also  scaled  up  the  implementation  efforts  by  piloting  Output 
Based Aid in several projects.  This has proven to be a successful endeavor in terms of delivering 
results, as further outlined in Box 6. 
            Box 6: OutputBased Aid in Uganda:  Targeting Support to Reach the Poor 
OutputBased Aid (OBA) involves performancebased subsidies that are channeled through a service 
provider after the provider has delivered preagreed outputs to targeted populations.  This is intended to 
increase transparency and the efficiency in use of funds.   
In no other IDA country has this resultsbased public funding targeting mechanism been used more widely 
than in Uganda.  Implementation of these OBA schemes began during the CAS period. 
   The ICT component of ERT I included $10.5m in OBA subsidies contributed by IDA with the objective to 
     accelerate access to voice telephony in rural areas, provide internet access in district headquarters, and 
     establish rural multipurpose telecenters at schools and hospitals.  The project has largely been 
     considered a success, with coverage expanding (e.g. over 10,000 public and private phones installed in 
     previously unserved subcounties), and average cost per minute of various services in rural areas 
     decreasing by almost 50%. 
   On energy, ERT I and ERT II both include OBA programs to increase rural electrification.  While ERT I 
     focused on (largely GEFfunded) offgrid photovoltaic systems funded through an OBA approach, ERT II 
     includes grid and minigrid based expansion to poor households through an OBA subsidy. 
   On health, KfW and GPOBA jointly funded an OBA scheme of $7.3m ($4.3m through the Bank
     administered GPOBA grant). This scheme aims to provide 110,000 safe deliveries and provide 
     treatment for 35,000 patients with sexuallytransmitted diseases.  The first healthy babies were 
     delivered under this scheme in FY09. 
   On water, a $3.2m grant was provided by GPOBA to improve access to piped drinking water in small 
     towns.  The project involved competitive bidding by local private operators, which resulted in clear 
     efficiency gains including several "zero subsidy" bids whereby the lowest bidder plans the required 
     expansion through private financing recouped through the tariff.  In 2008, a $2.6m GPOBA grant was 
     provided to the NWSC, for expansion of propoor yard taps and standposts into slum and periurban 
     areas of Kampala to be spearheaded by NWSC's Urban ProPoor Branch.  By FY09, over 25,000 
     residents in Greater Kampala received improved access through the scheme. 
Valuable lessons have been learned, not only for Uganda, but for the WBG more widely, including: 
   For OBA to work, service providers must have access to affordable finance to "prefinance" output 
     delivery.  More work is needed in this area, especially in IDA countries. 
   OBA schemes in basic services involve working with local private (including NGO) providers; sufficient 
     time and capacity building must be considered, especially with pilots.  
   Bank fiduciary systems can work with OBA, but greater knowledge sharing is needed. 


TRUST FUNDS 

145. The  CAS  did  not  include  a  description  of  the  application  and  strategic  use  of  trust  funds, 
despite the portfolio containing several large trust funds at the beginning of the CAS period.  The 
following is therefore based on an assessment of trust funds implemented during the CAS period. 
146. Over  the  CAS  period,  the  Uganda  program  included  disbursements  from  48  trust  funds 
(including IFC trust funds) providing more than $47m in grants, cf. annex 7.  More than half of the 
trust funds were Bank executed, but in terms of volume, 91 percent of the trust fund commitments 


                                                      119  
 
and  disbursements  were  recipient  executed.  The  majority  of  trust  funds  were  closely  linked  to 
lending operations and thus aligned with the Government's priorities.  
147. Trust funds focused mainly on: i. environment and sustainable energy (GEF); ii. piloting of 
outputbased  aid  in  health  and  water  supply  (GPOBA);  iii.  support  through  the  MDRP  to 
demobilization  and  reintegration  of  excombatants  from  the  conflict  in  northern  Uganda;  iv. 
support to prepare Uganda's response to avian flu; and v. support to strengthening the monitoring 
and evaluation system of the PEAP.   Trust funds also contributed to the completion of various AAA 
during  the  CAS  period,  including  the  CEM  and  the  report  on  Land  Policies  in  northern  Uganda,  a 
study on sanitation, a Poverty and Inequality study, and a NUSAF Impact Evaluation report.   
148. Projects  that  integrated  major  trust  funds  in  design  and  implementation  include  LVEMP, 
ERT I, NUSAF, Emergency and Demobilization and PAMSU. Of the trust funds closed, five were rated 
by  implementation  completion  memoranda  or  ICRs.    Three  were  rated  moderately  satisfactory  in 
development  outcome,23  and  two  were  rated  satisfactory.24    Assessments  did  not  reveal  cross 
cutting  lessons  learned  in  terms  of  the  use  of  trust  funds,  but  focused  on  the  effectiveness  and 
outcomes within each project.  
149. Looking forward, the new CAS should ensure that trust funds are integrated in the strategic 
framework, including the results framework, for Bank assistance to the country, both on the lending 
and the nonlending side.  

REGIONAL PROJECTS, TRUST FUNDS, AND AAAS 

150. While acknowledging the importance of regional integration for Uganda's development, and 
including  regional  projects  as  part  of  the  lending  program,  the  CAS  did  not  in  detail  assess  the 
implications  of  and  opportunities  for  regional  integration  and  how  to  address  this  strategically 
under the CAS; nor did the CAS include regional indicators in the results framework.  
151. During the CAS period, there were five regional operations involving Uganda.  Commitments 
amounted to $475m, of which IDA contributions from Uganda amounted to $55m, cf. Annex 2 and 
Annex 8.  During the CAS period, one regional project closed (LVEMP), two projects were approved 
(East  Africa  Trade  and  Transport  Facilitation  Project  and  LVEMP2),  one  project  slipped  (East 
Africa Regional Power Project) and one was dropped (RCIP).  By the end of FY09, one project was 
rated satisfactory and the other three were rated moderately satisfactory.  Two additional regional 
operations  including  Uganda  are  in  the  pipeline  for  FY10  (East  Africa  Agriculture  Productivity 
Project and East Africa  Health Systems Strengthening), and at least another two regional projects 
are in the pipeline for FY1113.   
152. Three  regional  trust  funded  projects  were  implemented  in  the  areas  of  agriculture, 
HIV/AIDS,  and  water  resources.  In  addition,  various  trust  funded  projects  supporting  activities 
under  the  Nile  Basin  Initiative  amounting  to  more  than  $66m  were  implemented  during  the  CAS 
period, including training, capacity building and institutional support (cf. Annex 10).  
153. Three regional ESWs and two regional TAs were delivered during the CAS period, mainly in 
the areas of supporting EAC integration (cf. Annex 9).

154. While  achieving  results,  regional  operations  have  been  facing  significant  implementation 
challenges due to coordination complexities both in projects and in handling many different clients 
simultaneously. This has often resulted in delays to project implementation and in preparation of 
new  projects.    Considering  the  importance  of  regional  integration,  these  challenges  need  to  be 
addressed under the new CAS. 

MIGA, IFC AND WBI 

155. Over  the  CAS  period,  IFC  focused  on  development  of  financial  markets,  infrastructure, 
agribusiness, support to the privatization program, and MSME development jointly with the World 
Bank.  The total IFC portfolio for Uganda as of August 2009 amounted to $202m, of which support 
to  the  Bujagali  Hydro  Power  Project  is  by  far  the  largest  activity  ($130m  loan).    IFC  committed  a 
$25m  loan  to  Umeme,  the  Uganda  electricity  distribution  company,  to  assist  its  expansion  of  the 
distribution network, increase connections and reduce technical losses.  Uganda is one of the pilot 
countries in the IFC/IDA MSME initiative, which supports access to finance, business development 
services, and business enabling environment.  IFC has also acted as an advisor to the Governments 
of  Kenya  and  Uganda  regarding  privatization  of  the  joint  KenyaUganda  railway  line,  and 
committed  $32m  for  the  railways  concession.  This  initiative  has  not  been  completed  and  is 
expected to be carried forward under the next CAS as part of a wider regional strategic engagement 
on infrastructure development in East Africa, including railways.  IFC provided technical assistance 
to local banks to develop housing finance skills and provided $16m loans to assist the growth of the 
mortgage  and  term  finance  for  SMEs,  of  which  $2m  was  dedicated  to  women  entrepreneurs.    IFC 
also  provided  trade  finance  support  to  Orient  Bank  and  a  risk  sharing  facility  to  a  microfinance 
institution to access funding from Citibank. 
            Box 7: Summary of IEG Evaluation of IFC Activities in Uganda 1999200825 
Between 1999 and 2008, IFC invested $187m in 10 projects in Uganda, including, power, 
telecommunications, financial sectors and small investments in agribusiness and education. IFC's main 
contribution has been in telecommunications where it helped restructure the sector and expand access to 
mobile communications. In addition, IFC provided assistance to the government to improve or create 
regulations in insurance, leasing and mortgage sectors and helped its clients to introduce new financial 
products. However, limited success was seen in the power sector, improving SMEs' access to financing and 
developing housing finance. IFC's experience in Uganda was characterized by strong government 
commitment to policy and institutional reform, a judicial mix of advisory services and investments and a 
close and well established relationships between IFC staff and clients. 
The main challenges for IFC going forward are: i. to promote more broadbased growth by increasing its 
support for nonfinancial sectors; ii. to maintain its support of the financial sector so that banks develop 
capacities to lend to SMEs and promote other underserved segments of the economy.  IEG recommends that 
IFC: i. finds new ways to reach small businesses; ii. remains engaged as an advisor in privatization 
transactions for a period after completion of the initial transaction; iii. considers the establishment of a field 
presence in smaller, high risk countries that have undertaken significant reforms and established favorable 
business environments; and iv. capitalizes on new opportunities presented by increasing southsouth 
investment flows. 

     
156. MIGA's  portfolio  in  Uganda  consists  of  three  projects  for  which  the  Agency  has  issued 
guarantees to investors incorporated in Bermuda, Luxembourg and St. Kitts & Nevis.  The projects 
are in support of the agribusiness and infrastructure sectors in Uganda and have a combined gross 
exposure of $158m.  MIGA continued the cooperation through a technical assistance program with 
the  Uganda  Investment  Authority  (UIA)  to  identify  new  projects.    MIGA  has  worked  consistently

with  Uganda  Investment  Authority  on  various  capacity  building  programs  over  the  years.  In 
addition,  Uganda  is  one  of  the  countries  covered  by  MIGA's  Africa  enterprise  benchmarking 
program,  a  program  which  is  linked  to  the  Bank's  investment  climate  assessment.  Building  on 
enterprise benchmarking program results, MIGA is working with UIA to secure donor funding for 
an investment outreach program. 
157. Uganda  continues  to  be  an  active  participant  in  WBI  programs,  averaging  over  800 
participants  annually over the past five years.  Multiyear  activities will continue in such areas  as 
support  to  oversight  institutions  (media  and  parliament)  and  economic  competitiveness  (public 
private partnership and financial sector management).  In addition, in FY09, WBI has implemented 
activities  in  local  governance,  water  and  rural  development,  science,  technology  and  innovation, 
carbon  finance,  southsouth  dialogues  with  Brazil  on  cluster  development,  and  climate  change. 
Regional  programs  in  areas  such  as  health  and  climate  change  have  also  been  attended  by 
participants from Uganda. 
158. Coordination  between  the  Bank,  IFC,  and  MIGA  should  be  improved  during  the  new  CAS.  
Several  of  the  key  challenges  facing  Uganda,  notably  infrastructure  investments,  deepening  of 
financial markets, commercialization of agriculture and water and sanitation, provide opportunities 
for the three institutions to complement each other in providing support to the client. 

CLIENT SURVEYS 

159. A Client Survey was completed in 2008.  The survey had 306 respondents and a response 
rate  of  56%,  with  respondents  representing  government  officials,  media,  private  sector,  civil 
society,  developments  partners  etc.    A  large  majority  of  respondents  think  the  Bank  considers  its 
primary  priority  in  Uganda  as  `ensuring  macroeconomic  stability  consistent  with  rapid  growth', 
followed  by  infrastructure,  private  sector  growth,  and  strengthening  public  sector  management.  
This is well aligned with identified development priorities in Uganda.  However, when asked which 
areas  the  Bank  should  focus  on  in  Uganda,  stakeholders  point  to  infrastructure,  agriculture, 
community empowerment, and private sector growth before identifying ensuring macroeconomic 
stability consistent with rapid growth.  
160. Outside of government, stakeholders are not positive about the Bank's effectiveness in the 
country.  While in some areas (e.g. infrastructure, growth and agriculture) the Bank's work is highly 
appreciated, stakeholders are less positive in the areas of governance, corruption and empowering 
communities.    These  findings  suggest  that  the  Bank  needs  to  become  more  effective  at 
demonstrating and communicating results achieved in Uganda. 

COUNTRY DIALOGUE AND AID COORDINATION 

161. The Bank enjoys a strong policy dialogue with the Government, underpinned by the Bank's 
analytical work and significant engagement in key sectors for development.  This is demonstrated 
by  government  requests  for  sector  investment  lending  operations  in  areas  covered  by  public 
expenditure reviews.  In addition, the Bank is frequently called upon to provide brief policy notes 
and other inputs to the ongoing policy debate. 
162. As  chair  of  the  development  partner  coordination  and  harmonization  forum,  the  Local 
Development Partners' Group, the Bank contributes to constructive dialogue between development 
partners as a group and the Government.  With more than 40 development partners (DPs) active in 
Uganda and DPs contributing significant amounts to the government budget and as a share of GDP, 
the  development  partner  coordination  apparatus  is  rather  large.    Nonetheless,  sector  dialogues 

                                                    122  
 
between the Government, development partners and other stakeholders are formalized through a 
range of sector working groups, technical working groups etc. 
163. The WB is working closely with the Government and other DPs in designing a Joint Budget 
Support Framework (JBSF) that is aligned to the budget cycle and sector processes. At the core of 
this is a multiannual Joint Assessment Framework (JAF) focusing on efficiency in public spending 
and enhanced service delivery, in support of the Government's own value for money agenda. 
164. While GoUDP dialogue at sector/thematic levels is generally rather constructive, it could be 
strengthened at the higher level.  In particular, there is scope for improving the effectiveness of aid 
if  the  Government  took  leadership  in  outlining  rules  and  guidelines  for  the  provision  of 
development assistance and the role and responsibilities of DPs in the country.  With the support of 
development  partners,  the  National  Development  Plan  has  a  chapter  on  the  Government's  Aid 
Policy, which is intended to provide the foundation and framework for improved aid coordination.  
With DPs signing up to GoU's Aid Policy, it will practically replace the need for a UJAS2. 
165. The  most  recent  Paris  Declaration  Monitoring  Survey  (2008)  refers  to  Uganda  as  a  front
runner on aid effectiveness.  Although there is room for improvement, progress is recorded on all 
Paris Declaration indicators.  The Ownership dimension of the Paris Declaration scores the highest 
mark  (High)  of  the  five  dimensions,  for  the  PEAP's  role  as  an  operational  strategy.    Given  the 
arguments put forward in this report, with the PEAP having become a largely irrelevant framework 
for  policy  implementation,  the  basis  for  this  rating  is  not  entirely  clear.    Nonetheless,  the  main 
lesson learned in the area of country dialogue and aid coordination is that the Bank should critically 
assess to what extent the new National Development Plan provides a reliable framework for policy 
implementation in Uganda before the next CAS is uncritically aligned with the NDP.  While this may 
not be fully known at the time of drafting the new CAS, the CAS Progress Report must assess this 
issue and, if necessary, realign the CAS at that stage. 


V.      L ESSONS  L EARNED AND  I SSUES TO BE  A DDRESSED BY THE NEXT  CAS 
General Lessons and Issues to be Addressed 
166. A joint strategy, elaborated with other development partners, is neither a necessary nor a 
sufficient condition for  more  effective  aid.  Rather than spending resources on elaborating a joint 
strategy, efforts should be devoted to developing an operational framework for alignment with the 
national  development  strategy,  for  allowing  dynamic  changes,  and  for  harmonization  and 
coordination  amongst  development  partners.    The  Joint  Budget  Support  Framework  (JBSF) 
currently being finalized is an example of such an operational framework. 
167. Full alignment with an incomplete and/or irrelevant national development strategy should 
be avoided.  A careful assessment of the completeness and strategic relevance of the new National 
Development  Plan  should  guide  the  formulation  of  the  next  CAS  for  Uganda.    While  a  full 
assessment of the relevance of the new  
168. The impact of a CAS may be reduced in cases where there is no or limited selectivity.  The 
Bank  should  consider  increased  focus  in  a  limited  number  of  sectors.    Due  to  inertia  in 
implementation of the ongoing portfolio, greater selectivity will not be achieved from the beginning 
on the new CAS.  Yet, rather than ensuring Bank presence in each and every sector, selectivity might 
improve the effectiveness of the program, possible combined with AAA in sectors where no lending 
is taking place. 
169. Credible,  concise  and  realistic  results  frameworks  for  the  CAS  and  for  individual  projects 
are  important  for  planning,  monitoring  and  budgeting  purposes,  including  realistic  targets  for 

                                                      123  
 
PRSCs  with  their  relative  short  lifecycle.    If  links  between  the  results  framework  of  individual 
projects  and  the  CAS  are  not  established,  operations  are  unlikely  to  contribute  effectively  to  the 
CAS' overall objectives. 
170. Successful  reforms  depend  on  strong  sector  involvement.    Therefore,  reforms  supported 
under  PRSCs  should  be  linked  to  sector  strategies  or  specific  sector  investment  operations.    A 
corollary to this insight is that long term sector reform issues should not be addressed exclusively 
through  APLs  or  SILs.    Reforms  may  still  be  pursued  through  the  PSRCs  in  areas  where  the  Bank 
does  not  have  lending  operations,  as  long  as  sector  challenges  are  effectively  addressed  by  other 
development partners. 
171. Delays to effectiveness (notably Parliamentary approval) have affected the performance of 
the  Bank  portfolio  throughout  the  CAS  period.    These  delays  are  largely  considered  to  be 
exogenous; if that is in fact the case, they should at least be anticipated at the project design stage.  
In addition, the Bank should encourage early involvement of relevant stakeholders during project 
design. 
172. On lending types and policy reforms: i. the Bank should avoid implementing phased APLs in 
parallel,  to  allow  for  incorporation  of  lessons  learned;  ii.  policy  reforms  should  not  be  combined 
with SILs as this tends to delay project implementation. 
173. To maximize the impact of the Bank's nonlending activities, all ESWs will need a plan and a 
budget for dissemination activities, as well as a plan for followup to the conclusions reached and 
advice provided. 
174. Portfolio  performance  reviews  are  only  useful  to  the  extent  that  followup  actions  are 
agreed to, followed up and eventually implemented.  A more careful approach to the design of CPPR 
events is needed in order to increase relevance of reviews and ensure timely implementation. 
Sector Specific Lessons and Issues to be Addressed 
175. For  continued  successful  economic  management,  focus  on  binding  constraints  to  future 
growth needs to be maintained.  With continued pressure on social services from the rapidly rising 
population, increased  efficiency in service delivery and  a reduction of public administration costs 
are  key  components  to  be  addressed.    Oil  revenue  management  poses  another  risk  (and 
opportunity) for continued macroeconomic stability.  
176. The success of direct Bank involvement in the agriculture sector will depend on a credible 
policy  and  institutional  framework  for  the  sector,  which  remains  outwardoriented  and  is  not 
influenced by political patronage considerations.  Further, progress in the agriculture sector needs 
a  crosssectoral  approach  including  better  rural  roads,  greater  access  to  electricity  and 
communication infrastructure, more marketing infrastructure and better access to finance in rural 
areas. 
177. The  Bank  will  need  to  address  the  Government's  limited  absorptive  capacity  in 
infrastructure investments and address the relatively high unit costs of roads to justify continued 
lending  to  the  sector.    Therefore,  in  the  next  CAS,  the  Bank  should  be  looking  at  how  the 
Government  can  enhance  the  effectiveness  and  transparency  in  the  use  of  funds  allocated  to  the 
infrastructure sector. 
178. Environment and natural resources programs need better integration in other development 
efforts  to  reach  desirable  and  sustainable  results,  but  this  may  not  necessarily  involve  Bank 
interventions in case other DPs are active in the area. 
179. The  Bank  must  adopt  a  clearer  framework  with  actionable  governance  indicators  and 
tracking mechanisms in support of the GAC agenda under the new CAS.  Not least in the run up to 

                                                     124  
 
general  elections  in  2011,  the  Bank  will  need  to  consider  its  role  visàvis  other  development 
partners with respect to advancing the GAC agenda in Uganda. 
180. Lessons from the CAS highlight that PRSCs may not always provide the optimal instrument 
for addressing health specific problems.  Further, the CAS program for the sector was not realistic 
and commensurate with the interventions undertaken. 
181. Addressing  the  population  issue  should  be  embedded  in  a  broader  crosssectoral 
framework  looking  not  just  at  health  and  family  planning,  but  also  focusing  on  youth 
unemployment, skills training, and public service delivery. 
182. The  PRSCs,  mainly  focusing  on  macro  level  reforms  across  financial  and  social  sectors,  do 
not  seem  to  be  the  best  available  instrument  for  influencing  change  regarding  the  community 
development  component  of  the  PEAP.    In  retrospect,  using  the  existing  interventions  on 
decentralization  and  public  sector  reforms  could  have  provided a  much  more  direct  and  possibly 
more effective intervention.
